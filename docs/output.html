<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog 6.0:
Configuring the output</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

So far we have mainly discussed commands which control how analog reads
the logfiles. We now get on to commands for configuring the output.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="outstyle">First, you can change the style</a> of the output using the
<kbd>OUTPUT</kbd> command. There
are seven possible output styles, called <kbd>XHTML</kbd>, <kbd>HTML</kbd>,
<kbd>PLAIN</kbd>, <kbd>ASCII</kbd>, <kbd>XML</kbd>, <kbd>LATEX</kbd> and
<kbd>COMPUTER</kbd>.
<p>
<kbd>XHTML</kbd> is the default. It produces web pages in XHTML 1.0.
<kbd>HTML</kbd> produces web pages in HTML 2.0.
<p>
<kbd>PLAIN</kbd> produces plain text files, and <kbd>ASCII</kbd> is the same
as <kbd>PLAIN</kbd> except that it uses all ASCII characters (no accents etc.)
if possible. (This is because some applications don't understand accented
characters).
<p>
<kbd>LATEX</kbd> produces LaTeX code which can be turned into PDF if you have
the <kbd>pdflatex</kbd> command installed. (If you want to use the ordinary
<kbd>latex</kbd> command, specify <kbd>PDFLATEX OFF</kbd>.) It's only
available with certain European languages (US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-2
character sets). Yes, I know it gives overfull hboxes sometimes.
<p>
<kbd>COMPUTER</kbd> is a special format suitable for reading by a
computer (useful for reading into a spreadsheet, or post-processing with a
graphics package, for example). 
There is a <a href="compout.html">separate section</a> about this
format later.
<p>
<kbd>XML</kbd> produces an XML output which is an alternative format for
post-processing. The DTD for the XML output is distributed with the program.
You can find more information about the XML style, and an example of a
post-processing program, at
<a href="http://timian.jessen.ch/">http://timian.jessen.ch/</a>.
<p>
As well as a command like
<pre>
OUTPUT PLAIN
</pre>
you can also select <kbd>PLAIN</kbd> style with the command line argument
<kbd>+a</kbd>, and <kbd>XHTML</kbd> with the command line argument
<kbd>-a</kbd>.
<p>
You can also specify <kbd>OUTPUT NONE</kbd>
for no output, if you are producing a <a href="cache.html">cache file</a>.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="LANGUAGE">Next, you can change the language</a> of the output. There
are two ways to do
this. The usual way is to use the <kbd>LANGUAGE</kbd> command. For example,
the command
<pre>
LANGUAGE FRENCH
</pre>
will give you the output in French. The available languages at the moment are
<kbd>ARMENIAN</kbd>, <kbd>BASQUE</kbd>, <kbd>BULGARIAN</kbd> (Windows-1251),
<kbd>BULGARIAN-MIK</kbd> (MIK-16), <kbd>CATALAN</kbd>,
<kbd>SIMP-CHINESE</kbd> (GB2312), <kbd>TRAD-CHINESE</kbd> (Big5),
<kbd>CZECH</kbd> (ISO Latin 2), <kbd>CZECH-1250</kbd> (Windows-1250),
<kbd>DANISH</kbd>, <kbd>DUTCH</kbd>, <kbd>ENGLISH</kbd>,
<kbd>US-ENGLISH</kbd>, <kbd>FINNISH</kbd>, <kbd>FRENCH</kbd>,
<kbd>GERMAN</kbd>, <kbd>HUNGARIAN</kbd>, <kbd>INDONESIAN</kbd>,
<kbd>ITALIAN</kbd>,
<kbd>JAPANESE-EUC</kbd> (EUC-JP), <kbd>JAPANESE-JIS</kbd> (ISO-2022-JP),
<kbd>JAPANESE-SJIS</kbd> (SJIS), <kbd>JAPANESE-UTF</kbd> (UTF-8),
<kbd>KOREAN</kbd>, <kbd>LATVIAN</kbd>, <kbd>NORWEGIAN</kbd> (Bokm&aring;l),
<kbd>NYNORSK</kbd>, <kbd>POLISH</kbd>, <kbd>PORTUGUESE</kbd>,
<kbd>BR-PORTUGUESE</kbd>, <kbd>RUSSIAN</kbd> (KOI8-R),
<kbd>RUSSIAN-1251</kbd> (Windows-1251), <kbd>SERBIAN</kbd>,
<kbd>SLOVAK</kbd> (ISO Latin 2), <kbd>SLOVAK-1250</kbd> (Windows-1250),
<kbd>SLOVENE</kbd> (ISO Latin 2),
<kbd>SLOVENE-1250</kbd> (Windows-1250), <kbd>SPANISH</kbd>, <kbd>SWEDISH</kbd>,
<kbd>SWEDISH-ALT</kbd> (alternative translation avoiding Anglicisms),
<kbd>TURKISH</kbd> and <kbd>UKRAINIAN</kbd>.
<p>
The following languages were available for previous versions of analog, but
have not yet been translated for version 5:
<kbd>BOSNIAN</kbd>, <kbd>CROATIAN</kbd>, <kbd>GREEK</kbd>,
<kbd>ICELANDIC</kbd>, <kbd>LITHUANIAN</kbd> and <kbd>ROMANIAN</kbd>.
As and when they are translated, they will be added to the
<a href="http://www.analog.cx/">analog home page</a>.
If you want to translate any of them (or any other language), I would be
delighted! See below.
<p>
The other way to specify a language is to use the <kbd>LANGFILE</kbd>
command. This is useful if you want to download a new language from the
<a href="http://www.analog.cx/">analog home page</a>, or
if you want to translate one yourself, or even if you want to change some
words or phrases or the way the dates and times are formatted in the output.
The <kbd>LANGFILE</kbd> command tells analog in which file to find the various
words and phrases for a new language. For example, the command
<pre>
LANGFILE guarani.lng   # or
LANGFILE /usr/etc/httpd/analog/lang/guarani.lng
</pre>
would read from that file.
If the name of the file doesn't include a directory, it will be
looked for wherever analog normally expects to find its language files.
<p>
Some languages also have <a href="domfile.html">domains files</a> or
report descriptions files available. These are normally selected automatically
by the <kbd>LANGUAGE</kbd> command. But you can tell analog to use different
ones with the <kbd><a href="domfile.html">DOMAINSFILE</a></kbd> and
<kbd><a href="#DESCRIPTIONS">DESCFILE</a></kbd> commands. Also, some languages
have translations of the <a href="form.html">form interface</a> or
configuration file.
<p>
If you want to translate another language, I would be delighted! Do
<a href="mailing.html">contact me first</a> to make sure that no-one else is
already translating the
same language. The file <kbd>README.txt</kbd> in the language directory, and
the English language file, contain some brief instructions for translating new
languages.
<p>
Equally, if you find any mistakes in the output in different languages, please
do <a href="mailing.html">let me know</a> because I'm not able to check them
all myself!

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="OUTFILE">You can change which file</a> the output goes to with
a command like
<pre>
OUTFILE stats.htm
</pre>
or with a command line argument like <kbd>+Ostats.htm</kbd>. If you use the
filename <kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>stdout</kbd>, the output will go to standard
output, which is normally the screen, but Unix users might like to redirect it
to another file or even into a pipe. You can also use an absolute path name,
like
<pre>
OUTFILE /usr/bin/httpd/htdocs/stats.html  # Unix
OUTFILE "Hard Disk:Server Apps:WebSTAR:Analog:Report.html" # Mac
</pre>
If the name of the <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> doesn't include a directory, it will be
put wherever analog expects to put its output files. (This location is built
in when the program is compiled.) For example, on Windows it would be in the
same folder as the analog executable. But if you use the <kbd>+O</kbd> command
line argument, the file is within the current directory.
<p>
You can include date codes in the <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> in exactly the same way
as for the <kbd><a href="logfile.html#datecodes">LOGFILE</a></kbd>.
So for example,
<pre>
OUTFILE stats%y%M%D.html
</pre>
will produce filenames like <kbd>stats990501.html</kbd>. As with the
<kbd>LOGFILE</kbd>, the date used is the <kbd>TO</kbd> date if one was
specified, and otherwise the time of the start of the program.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="replist">Next, you need to know how to turn the different reports on
and off.</a> There are 44 different reports which analog can produce,
if your web server has been configured to record the necessary data in the
logfiles. Each one has a short name, and a code letter or number, as
follows. (Note that the code letters are case sensitive:
<kbd>Z</kbd> is quite different from <kbd>z</kbd>, for example).
<pre>
x  <kbd>GENERAL</kbd>         General Summary
1  <kbd>YEARLY</kbd>          Yearly Report
Q  <kbd>QUARTERLY</kbd>       Quarterly Report

J  <kbd>FAILUSER</kbd>        User Failure Report
c  <kbd>STATUS</kbd>          Status Code Report
</pre>
For details on what the various reports mean, and a summary of the commands
which control them, see the section on
<cite><a href="reports.html">Analog's reports</a></cite>.
<p>
<a name="ONOFF">You can turn each report on or off</a> with configuration
commands like
<pre>
FIVEREP OFF
REFSITE ON
</pre>
or by using command line arguments like <kbd>-5</kbd> and <kbd>+s</kbd>.
You can also turn all reports except the General Summary on or off with the
commands <kbd>ALL ON</kbd> and <kbd>ALL OFF</kbd>, or with the command line
arguments <kbd>+A</kbd> and <kbd>-A</kbd>.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="DESCRIPTIONS">You can turn</a> the descriptions of each report off
with the command
<pre>
DESCRIPTIONS OFF
</pre>
Even if <kbd>DESCRIPTIONS</kbd> is <kbd>ON</kbd>, the descriptions will only
appear if analog can find a report descriptions file in your language, or if
you specify one using the <kbd>DESCFILE</kbd> command: for example,
<pre>
DESCFILE descriptions.txt
</pre>
If the name of the descriptions file doesn't include a directory, it will be
looked for wherever analog normally expects to find its language files.
<p>
<a name="GOTOS">You can turn the &quot;Go To&quot; lines</a> in the output off
with the command
<pre>
GOTOS OFF
</pre>
<kbd>GOTOS ON</kbd> turns them on again, and <kbd>GOTOS FEW</kbd> puts the
&quot;Go To&quot; lines just at the top and bottom. <kbd>GOTOS OFF</kbd> can
be abbreviated with the <kbd>-X</kbd> command line argument, and
<kbd>GOTOS ON</kbd> with <kbd>+X</kbd>.
<p>
<a name="RUNTIME">You can turn</a> off the &quot;Program started at&quot; line
at the top of the output, and the &quot;Running Time&quot; line at the
bottom, with the command
<pre>
RUNTIME OFF
</pre>
and turn them on again with <kbd>RUNTIME ON</kbd>.
<p>
<a name="LASTSEVEN">The figures in parentheses</a> in the General Summary are
for the last seven days:
either the seven days before the <kbd>TO</kbd> time, or if no <kbd>TO</kbd>
time is given, the seven days before the time of the program start. The
figures for the last seven days are normally included if some, but not all,
of the requests fall in those seven days; but you can turn them off by means
of the command
<pre>
LASTSEVEN OFF
</pre>
Of course <kbd>LASTSEVEN ON</kbd> turns them on again.
<p>
<a name="REPORTORDER">You can change the order</a> of the reports by means of
the <kbd>REPORTORDER</kbd> command. You should list the
<a href="#replist">code letters</a> for all possible reports in the order
you want them. Non-alphanumeric characters are ignored and so can be used as
separators. For example,
<pre>
REPORTORDER x-1QmdDhHw4567W-cPz-ritEIYy-SlLZo-sNnfKk-ujJ-vMR-bBp
</pre>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="GENSUMLINES">You can turn</a> the lines in General Summary on and off
individually using the <kbd>GENSUMLINES</kbd> command. The default is
<pre>
GENSUMLINES ALL
</pre>
meaning all available lines. (You always only get the ones relevant to your
logfile though.) You can turn lines off using a command like
<pre>
GENSUMLINES -KL
</pre>
(to turn off lines <kbd>K</kbd> &amp; <kbd>L</kbd>) and turn them on again
with a command like
<pre>
GENSUMLINES +K
</pre>
You can specify the exact set of lines to include with a command like
<pre>
GENSUMLINES CDFGHM
</pre>
You now just need to know which lines have which code letters, which is given
in the following table.
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>&nbsp;</kbd><dd>Successful requests (always listed)
  <dt><kbd>B</kbd><dd>Average successful requests per day
  <dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd>Logfile lines without status code
  <dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Successful requests for pages
  <dt><kbd>E</kbd><dd>Average successful requests for pages per day
  <dt><kbd>F</kbd><dd>Failed requests
  <dt><kbd>G</kbd><dd>Redirected requests
  <dt><kbd>H</kbd><dd>Requests with informational status code
  <dt><kbd>I</kbd><dd>Distinct files requested
  <dt><kbd>J</kbd><dd>Distinct hosts served
  <dt><kbd>K</kbd><dd>Corrupt logfile lines
  <dt><kbd>L</kbd><dd>Unwanted logfile entries
  <dt><kbd>M</kbd><dd>Data transferred
  <dt><kbd>N</kbd><dd>Average data transferred per day
</dl>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="IMAGEDIR">There is a command called <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd></a>
which tells analog where the various images used to make the output page should
live. It should be a URL, not the actual location on your disk, and it should
include the final slash. For example, you could have
<pre>
IMAGEDIR img/   # relative URL: within the same directory as the output
IMAGEDIR /img/  # off the root directory of your server
IMAGEDIR http://www.myother.server.com/img/  # on another server
</pre>
Some people are confused about the <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd>. It's just put in the
&lt;img&gt; tags in the output. You can see its effect if you look at the HTML
source of the output page.
<p>
<a name="PNGIMAGES">You can use gif images instead of png's</a> for the bar
charts by specifying
<pre>
PNGIMAGES OFF
</pre>
<kbd>PNGIMAGES</kbd> doesn't affect
the pie charts, which are always png's: but see the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#CHARTDIR">JPEGCHARTS</a></kbd> command for something
similar.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="LOGO">There are four commands</a> which affect the top line of the
output. First,
the <kbd>LOGO</kbd> and <kbd>LOGOURL</kbd> commands allow you to replace the
analog logo with another image (for example, your organisation's logo). You
can say
<pre>
LOGO picture.gif  # for this file
LOGO /images/picture2.gif  # a different file
LOGO none         # for no logo
</pre>
The logo is assumed to be inside the <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd> unless it starts
with a slash, or contains <kbd>://</kbd>
<p>
The <kbd>LOGOURL</kbd> command specifies a URL to link the logo to. If you
change the <kbd>LOGO</kbd>, you probably want to change the <kbd>LOGOURL</kbd>
as well. For example,
<pre>
LOGOURL http://www.mycompany.com/
LOGOURL none   # for no link
</pre>
The <kbd>LOGOURL</kbd> command only works with the XHTML output style, not
HTML 2.0.
<p>
<a name="HOSTNAME">There</a> are commands <kbd>HOSTNAME</kbd> and
<kbd>HOSTURL</kbd> which
affect the name and link at the end of the title line. For example, I might
specify
<pre>
HOSTNAME "Stephen Turner"
HOSTURL  http://homepage.ntlworld.com/adelie/stephen/
</pre>
to generate the title &quot;Web Server Statistics for
<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/adelie/stephen/">Stephen Turner</a>&quot;.
Again, you can use <kbd>none</kbd> as the <kbd>HOSTURL</kbd> to specify no
link. Analog will normally translate characters in the hostname to HTML if
necessary. So to include literal HTML, such as accented characters, in the
output you need to precede them by a backslash, like this: 
<pre>
HOSTNAME &quot;M\&amp;uuml;ller &amp; S\&amp;ouml;hne&quot;
</pre>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="HEADERFILE">There are commands</a> called <kbd>HEADERFILE</kbd> and
<kbd>FOOTERFILE</kbd>.
These let you specify files to be inserted near the top and bottom of your
output. You can also specify
<pre>
HEADERFILE none
</pre>
to cancel a previously-specified header file.
Again, if the name of the <kbd>HEADERFILE</kbd> or <kbd>FOOTERFILE</kbd>
doesn't include a directory, analog will assume a directory, specified
when the program was compiled.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="STYLESHEET">There is a command</a> called <kbd>STYLESHEET</kbd> to
specify the URL of a style sheet for the output. This allows you to change the
colours etc.
(See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/css/">http://www.w3.org/Style/css/</a>
for how to write a style sheet.) For example,
<pre>
STYLESHEET /housestyle.css
STYLESHEET none   # to cancel it
</pre>
In the XHTML output style, if you specify a style sheet, it will
<em>replace</em> the default one, so you might prefer to use the default one
as a base -- you can find it in the directory <kbd>examples/css</kbd>, along
with some other style sheets contributed by users.
<p>
There is a command <kbd>CSSPREFIX</kbd> to add a prefix to all the CSS class
names used in the XHTML output style. This is useful to avoid clashes with
other style sheets: the disadvantage is that it will make your output longer.
For example,
<pre>
CSSPREFIX anlg
CSSPREFIX none    # to cancel it
</pre>
Of course, if you use your own style sheet, you will have to add the
<kbd>CSSPREFIX</kbd> to all the class names in the style sheet.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="SEPCHAR">There are three</a> related commands called
<kbd>SEPCHAR</kbd>,
<kbd>REPSEPCHAR</kbd> and <kbd>DECPOINT</kbd>. These specify single characters
to be used as the thousands separator in numbers, the thousands separator
within the columns in the reports, and the decimal point. Normally, these will
be set automatically for the <a href="#LANGUAGE">language</a> you choose, but
you can change them if you want. For example, a French user might choose
<pre>
SEPCHAR " "
REPSEPCHAR none
DECPOINT ,
</pre>
to make &quot;three thousand and a quarter&quot; look like
&quot;3&nbsp;000,25&quot; in text and &quot;3000,25&quot; in the reports.

<p>
<a name="RAWBYTES">There is a command</a> called <kbd>RAWBYTES</kbd>. Specify
<kbd>RAWBYTES ON</kbd>
if you want the exact number of bytes to be listed, or
<kbd>RAWBYTES OFF</kbd> if you want the number of kilobytes or Megabytes
as appropriate to be listed instead.
<p>
If <kbd>RAWBYTES</kbd> is <kbd>OFF</kbd>
(which is the default), then you can use the <kbd>BYTESDP</kbd> command to
specify how many decimal places you want the bytes rounded to. The default is
2, which will display numbers like &quot;91.26 kilobytes&quot;.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="PAGEWIDTH">There</a> are commands called
<kbd>HTMLPAGEWIDTH</kbd>, <kbd>PLAINPAGEWIDTH</kbd> and
<kbd>LATEXPLAINWIDTH</kbd> which specify the
width of the page. Which one is used depends on whethere the output style is
<kbd>HTML</kbd>/<kbd>XHTML</kbd>, <kbd>PLAIN</kbd>/<kbd>ASCII</kbd>, or
<kbd>LATEX</kbd>. The output is not guaranteed to fit in this width, but
analog will take notice of it when choosing the width of the time graphs,
when sorting the Host Report alphabetically, when drawing horizontal rules,
and when writing some bits of text.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="NOROBOTS">There is a command</a> called <kbd>NOROBOTS</kbd> which
stops robots which obey the
<a href="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html#meta">robots META tag</a>
from indexing your output page or following its links. Normally this is set to
<kbd>ON</kbd> but you can specify <kbd>NOROBOTS OFF</kbd> if you don't mind
robots finding your other pages this way. Note that you will stop far more
robots if you also put your stats page in your
<kbd><a href="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html#robotstxt">robots.txt</a></kbd>
file; on the other hand, this file has to be kept up to date by the server
administrator.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="TIMEOFFSET">Sometimes</a> your server is not in the same timezone as
you, or at least records the times in its logfiles in a different timezone
(for example GMT). So that you can get your
statistics in your local time, there is a command called
<kbd>LOGTIMEOFFSET</kbd> to change the time by a certain number of minutes. As
with the <kbd><a href="logfmt.html">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> command, this only
affects logfiles which come <em>later</em> in the <em>same</em> configuration
file.
<p>
You have to be careful using this command. Because of
daylight savings time in operation in different parts of the world at
different times, analog cannot attempt to convert between different
timezones. So it's your responsibility to set the right offset for different
times of year. For example, if you were in Chicago, but your server was
recording time in GMT, you would need to specify two different time offsets,
one of minus five hours for summer and one of minus six hours for winter. You
would need to split your logfiles in the right places and then run commands
like
<pre>
LOGTIMEOFFSET -300
LOGFILE summer*.log
LOGTIMEOFFSET -360
LOGFILE winter*.log
</pre>
<p>
There is also a related command called <kbd>TIMEOFFSET</kbd>. This tells
analog how much to offset the time of the computer on which it is running
(rather than the computer running the server), to get your local time. 

<hr size=1 noshade>
In the following sections we shall look at some commands for configuring the
output of particular
reports, under the following headings: <cite><a href="timereps.html">Time
reports</a></cite>, <cite><a href="othreps.html">Other reports</a></cite>
and <cite><a href="hierreps.html">Hierarchical reports</a></cite>.

<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0: Aliases</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

<a name="CASE">After</a> analog has read each logfile entry, it then applies
aliases to each
of the items. First, if you have a case insensitive filesystem, analog
converts the filename to lower case. Usually analog assumes that Unix and BeOS
filesystems are case sensitive and other systems are case insensitive. You
might want to override its choice, if, for example, you have transferred files
from one machine to another, so as to use the convention on the original
machine. You can do this by the commands
<pre>
CASE INSENSITIVE
CASE SENSITIVE
</pre>
There are similar commands for usernames, if your logfile records these. By
default, usernames are always case insensitive, but you can specify
<pre>
USERCASE SENSITIVE
</pre>
to override this.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="DIRSUFFIX">Next it</a> applies built-in aliases to each item. For
example, it knows that
<kbd>%7E</kbd> in a filename or referrer is equivalent to <kbd>~</kbd> and
translates it accordingly. It also strips off the directory suffix from any
filenames which have it. This suffix is normally <kbd>index.html</kbd>, but
you can specify another one instead with a command such as
<pre>
DIRSUFFIX default.htm
</pre>
(You can only have one <kbd>DIRSUFFIX</kbd>.) There are other built-in
aliases for other items: for example, hostnames are converted to lower case
at this point.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="useraliases">After this</a>, it applies user-specified aliases to
each item. These aliases are
useful if, for example, you know that two filenames correspond to the same
file, or if you want to translate local hostnames to their internet
equivalents. You specify aliases by commands like
<pre>
FILEALIAS /football.html /soccer.html
HOSTALIAS lion lion.statslab.cam.ac.uk
</pre>
There is also the special command <kbd>FILEALIAS none</kbd>, which cancels
any other file aliases which might have been specified.

<p>
The alias commands for the other items are called <kbd>BROWALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>REFALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>USERALIAS</kbd> and <kbd>VHOSTALIAS</kbd>.
Only one alias is ever applied to any item. So after
<pre>
FILEALIAS /football.html /soccer.html
FILEALIAS /soccer.html /brazil.html
</pre>
the file <kbd>/soccer.html</kbd> would get translated to
<kbd>/brazil.html</kbd>, but <kbd>/football.html</kbd> would only get
translated to <kbd>/soccer.html</kbd> and would not see the second alias.
<p>
You can also use wildcards in <kbd>ALIAS</kbd> commands: <kbd>?</kbd> matches
any one character and <kbd>*</kbd> matches any number of characters (including
none).
And on the right-hand side, you can use <kbd>$1</kbd>, <kbd>$2</kbd> etc. to
represent the parts of the original name matched by the <kbd>*</kbd>'s.
As a special abbreviation, if there is exactly one <kbd>*</kbd> on the
left-hand side, then a <kbd>*</kbd> on the right-hand side can be used to
represent <kbd>$1</kbd>. So, for example,
<pre>
FILEALIAS /*/football/* /soccer/
</pre>
would translate <kbd>/sport/football/rules.html</kbd> to just
<kbd>/soccer/</kbd>, but either of
<pre>
FILEALIAS /*/football/* /$1/soccer/$2         # or
FILEALIAS /sport/football/* /sport/soccer/*
</pre>
would translate <kbd>/sport/football/rules.html</kbd> to
<kbd>/sport/soccer/rules.html</kbd>.
<p>
You can use <kbd>$$</kbd> to get an actual <kbd>$</kbd> on the right-hand side.
Or you can prefix the right-hand side with &quot;<kbd>PLAIN:</kbd>&quot; to
treat any <kbd>$</kbd>'s and <kbd>*</kbd>'s on the right-hand side literally.
For example
<pre>
FILEALIAS /*/football/* PLAIN:/$1/soccer/$2
</pre>
would translate <kbd>/sport/football/rules.html</kbd> to exactly
<kbd>/$1/soccer/$2</kbd>
<p>
Analog's <kbd>*</kbd>'s are un-greedy: if there are two possible ways of
matching, the part of the expression on the left matches as little as
possible. This is more often what you want. But it contrasts with Perl's
regular expressions, for example. (Oh, two consecutive <kbd>*</kbd>'s are
completely useless, but if you try it they are collapsed into one before
counting the <kbd>$1</kbd>, <kbd>$2</kbd>, etc.)
<p>
The behaviour of <kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd> and <kbd>REFALIAS</kbd> can be
slightly unintuitive if the file has <a href="args.html#unintuitive">search
arguments</a>.
<p>
A warning to Unix users: if you put an <kbd>ALIAS</kbd> command on the
command line with <kbd><a href="syntax.html#plusC">+C</a></kbd>, the shell
may try and expand <kbd>$1</kbd> etc., which is not what you want. To stop
the shell doing this, put the command in single quotes instead of double
quotes.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="OUTPUTALIAS">There is another set</a> of alias commands, called
<i>output aliases</i>. They don't alias <em>items</em>, but <em>individual
lines from particular reports</em> (and they never combine lines, even if two
lines end up with the same name). For example, the command
<pre>
TYPEALIAS .txt ".txt (Plain text files)"
</pre>
would provide an explanation of that line in the File Type Report.

<p>
There can be some confusion between some normal alias and
output alias commands. For example, what is the difference between
<kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd> and <kbd>REQALIAS</kbd>? In fact, there are
several differences because of the different things the aliases are doing.
<kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd> applies to the <em>files themselves</em>,
but <kbd>REQALIAS</kbd> only applies to the <em>lines in the Request
Report</em>. This means that <kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd> also affects the other
reports which use the filenames, such as the Directory Report, whereas
<kbd>REQALIAS</kbd> only affects the Request Report.
<p>
Another difference is that
<kbd>REQALIAS</kbd> applies separately to each line of the Request
Report. This means that if two separate files translate to the same thing in a
<kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd> command, they will become one file for all the reports.
But if you were to use the same <kbd>REQALIAS</kbd> command, they would
still be two files, and would still be listed on separate lines in the Request
Report, but with the same name.
<p>
So in summary, when should you use each command? <kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd> should
be used if a single file has two different names; i.e., if your web server
returns the same file for two different URLs. <kbd>REQALIAS</kbd>, on the
other hand, would typically be used to annotate or clarify the Request Report.
Sometimes it's useful to use both; first combine some files with
<kbd>FILEALIAS</kbd>, and then annotate them in the Request Report with
<kbd>REQALIAS</kbd>.
<p>
The full list of output aliases is <kbd>REQALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>TYPEALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>DIRALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>HOSTREPALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRHOSTALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>FAILHOSTALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>DOMALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>ORGALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>REFREPALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>REFSITEALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>FAILREFALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>BROWREPALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSUMALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>OSALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>VHOSTREPALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRVHOSTREPALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILVHOSTREPALIAS</kbd>, <kbd>USERREPALIAS</kbd>,
<kbd>REDIRUSERALIAS</kbd> and <kbd>FAILUSERALIAS</kbd>.
<p>
There is one known bug with the output aliases. The report is sorted
before the alias is applied. This means that if the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#SORTBY">SORTBY</a></kbd> for the report is set to
<kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd>, then the report will not be sorted correctly.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="aliasregexp">You can also use regular expressions</a> in the
<kbd>ALIAS</kbd> commands.
Sorry, I'm not going to teach you how to use regular expressions
here if you don't already know: if you're on Unix try typing <kbd>man
perlre</kbd> or <kbd>man regex</kbd> or <kbd>man grep</kbd>. There are lots of
implementations of regular expressions. The ones which analog uses are
Perl-syntax regular expressions. In general, these are a superset of the
extended regular expressions used by Unix <kbd>egrep</kbd> or GNU
<kbd>grep&nbsp;-E</kbd>.
<p>
You include regular expressions in an <kbd>ALIAS</kbd> command by prefixing
the left-hand side of the alias with &quot;<kbd>REGEXP:</kbd>&quot;. Or you can
specify a case-insensitive match, like Perl <kbd>m//i</kbd> or
Unix <kbd>egrep&nbsp;-i</kbd>, by using
&quot;<kbd>REGEXPI:</kbd>&quot;. (It's automatically case-insensitive for many
items, such as hostnames, or filenames if you have specified
<kbd><a href="#CASE">CASE INSENSITIVE</a></kbd>.)
<p>
On the
right-hand side of the alias you can use <kbd>$1</kbd>, <kbd>$2</kbd> etc. to
represent the first, second etc. bracketed expression on the left-hand side,
counting in order of the left brackets. (Again, you can't put <kbd>$1</kbd>,
<kbd>$2</kbd> etc. on the command line unless you put them in single quotes.)
<p>
Regular expressions match if they match just part of the string. If you want
them to have to match the whole of the string, you have to anchor them to the
ends of the string with <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd>.
<p>
For example,
<pre>
REQALIAS REGEXP:^(/~(.+?)/.*) "[$2] $1"
</pre>
would translate <pre>/~sret1/backgammon/rules.html</pre> to
<pre>[sret1] /~sret1/backgammon/rules.html</pre> in the Request
Report. Or
<pre>
HOSTALIAS REGEXP:^([^.]*)$ $1.mycompany.com
</pre>
would add <kbd>.mycompany.com</kbd> to all hostnames not containing a dot.
(See the <a href="faq.html#faq174">FAQ</a> for a discussion about whether
this is a good idea.)
<p>
Regular expressions are greedy: if there are two possible ways of matching,
the part of the expression on the left matches as much as possible.

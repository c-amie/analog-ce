<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0: DNS lookups</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

Sometimes a logfile contains numerical IP addresses - like 131.111.20.59 -
for the computers that have visited you, instead of names like
lion.statslab.cam.ac.uk. This section describes how you can get analog
to do so-called <i>DNS lookups</i> to translate these numbers into names.
This relies on you having a suitably configured system: DNS lookups are
not possible on some systems.
<p>
First a note. Because analog's DNS lookups use only standard,
platform-independent code, they are slower than lookups optimised for
particular platforms. (This is especially true on platforms without the
<kbd>DNSTIMEOUT</kbd> command described below.) So if you are doing DNS
lookups regularly, you will probably be better off using one of the many
specialist DNS lookup programs which you can find on the
<a href="helpers.html">helper applications</a> page.

<hr size=1 noshade>
DNS lookups are typically rather slow, because your computer
has to ask across the network to find out the names of the hosts. For this
reason, analog saves the addresses it has looked up in a file, so that you
don't have to look them up again next time. The file is specified by a command
like
<pre>
DNSFILE dnscache
</pre>
You will still need to use one of the commands in the next paragraph
in order to actually use the file.
If the name of the <kbd>DNSFILE</kbd> doesn't include a directory, it will be
looked for wherever analog expects to find its DNS files. (This
location is built in when the program is compiled.) For example, on
Windows it would be in the same folder as the analog executable.
<p>
There are four possible levels of DNS activity. If you specify
<kbd>DNS NONE</kbd>, no numerical addresses will be resolved. If you specify
<kbd>DNS READ</kbd>, then analog will read the DNS file for old lookups, but
no new lookups will take place. This mode is suitable if you are running
analog while not connected to the internet. The third level is
<kbd>DNS WRITE</kbd>. This reads the old file, looks up new addresses,
and adds them to the file. (The first time you use <kbd>DNS WRITE</kbd>, you
will get a missing-file warning as it tries to read the old file, but it will
exist the next time.) The final level is <kbd>DNS LOOKUP</kbd>. This
reads the old file and looks up new addresses, but doesn't add the new
addresses to the file, so that they will not be remembered for next time.
This is not normally a level that the user wants to specify, but analog will
switch to this the behaviour if <kbd>DNS WRITE</kbd> fails for some reason.

<p>
If you are using a <kbd><a href="include.html">HOSTEXCLUDE</a></kbd> command,
you need to exclude the numerical IP address if it can't be resolved, or the
name if it can. In other words, exclude whatever the host is known as in the
Host Report.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="DNSLOCKFILE">If two copies</a> of analog were allowed to write to the
DNS file at the
same time, the file could become corrupted. So when analog is running in
<kbd>DNS WRITE</kbd> mode, it creates a <em>lock file</em> which tells other
copies of analog to back off to <kbd>DNS LOOKUP</kbd>. You can change the
location of that file with the command
<pre>
DNSLOCKFILE filename
</pre>
Of course you should make sure that all copies of analog use the same lock
file, at least if they have the same DNS file!
Again, if the name of the <kbd>DNSLOCKFILE</kbd> doesn't include a directory,
it will put in a canonical location, specified when the program was compiled.
<p>
If analog crashes, it may not
clear up the lock file, so in that case you may have to delete it yourself.
(Disclaimer: on some systems, race conditions may occasionally thwart this
mechanism, but this is very unlikely.)

<p>
Analog never deletes anything from the DNS file: this means that the DNS
file will grow, and can become quite large. You should delete the top of
it every so often. There is a program on the <a href="helpers.html">helper
applications</a> page to help you do this more systematically.

<p>
<a name="DNShours">There are two</a> parameters which say how long to trust
old lookups for. If you set
<pre>
DNSGOODHOURS 672
</pre>
for example, then successful lookups will be checked again after 672 hours
(4 weeks). You can also set the <kbd>DNSBADHOURS</kbd> similarly, to check
failed lookups again after a certain time. By default the
<kbd>DNSBADHOURS</kbd> is 336 (2 weeks) and the <kbd>DNSGOODHOURS</kbd> is a
very large number (so that successful lookups are never rechecked, as long as
they remain in the DNS file).

<p>
<a name="DNSTIMEOUT">On some platforms</a> (maybe only Unix) you can set a
parameter called <kbd>DNSTIMEOUT</kbd>. If the DNS server still hasn't
returned a reply within this many seconds, then the lookup will be
aborted. <em>However</em>, this feature is off by default, because it breaks
DNS lookups on many platforms. (The symptom is that the first few lookups
succeed, but after a while, all lookups fail). If you try it, monitor it, and
turn it off again if it causes problems.

<p>
Finally, there is a <a href="debug.html#debugs">debugging</a> command,
<kbd>DEBUG +D</kbd> to show all the DNS lookups that analog is making.

<hr size=1 noshade>
Normally you need never write a DNS file: you should rely on analog to do it
for you. But in case you need to know, the format of the file is
<pre>
timestamp IP_address name
</pre>
where the timestamp is the number of minutes since the beginning of 1970, GMT
(i.e., &quot;Unix time&quot; divided by 60), and the name is just <kbd>*</kbd>
if the address couldn't be resolved.

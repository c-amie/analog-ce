<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0:
Form interface and CGI program</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

The form interface provides an HTML front end to analog, on Unix or Windows
platforms (and maybe others). That means that users can select options from a
web page, instead of having to create a configuration file.

<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> For <strong><a href="#notcgi">security
reasons</a></strong>, you must not attempt to run analog itself as a CGI
program, or even leave it in the directory or folder with your web files or
CGI programs. When the form interface runs analog for you, it checks that
analog isn't given any dangerous options. Without this check, your system
could be vulnerable to attack.

<p>
The form interface is suitable for ordinary users to use, but it <b>needs to be
set up by a system administrator</b> or other expert. In order to set it up,
you have to be running a web server. You need to know what CGI programs
are, where they live on your server, and how to set up their permissions
properly. You also need to know how to write HTML forms. I shall assume this
level of background knowledge for the rest of this section. And you have to be
running Perl 5.001 or later: see <cite><a href="#formtech">Technical
details</a></cite> below for other system requirements. (Actually, if you're
on Windows and don't have Perl, you can download an executable version of the
form interface from the <a href="helpers.html">helper applications page</a>.)

<p>
Please don't try and set up the form until analog has been set up and is
running properly on its own. It just adds another level of complexity to
troubleshoot. And unlike analog itself, the form interface will <em>not</em>
run &quot;out of the box&quot;. You have to <strong>read the whole of this
section to find out how to set it up safely.</strong>

<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> CGI programs can contain security loopholes which
allow an unscrupulous user to harm your system. (If you don't know about this,
you shouldn't be running CGI programs at all. Read and understand the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/">World Wide Web Security FAQ</a> and
the <a href="http://www.improving.org/paulp/cgi-security/safe-cgi.txt">CGI
Security FAQ</a> first.) I have tried to make this form interface safe, but I
cannot guarantee it. Even the most carefully-designed CGI programs can
accidentally have serious security bugs. And I take no responsibility if
anything goes wrong: you use it at your own risk. (See the
<a href="Licence.txt">licence</a>.)  Furthermore, you should be aware that
unless you take special measures like password protection or limiting
<kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> to specific hostnames, setting up the form interface
implies making analog executable, and your logfiles analysable, by anyone on
the internet. It's usually a bad idea to allow this, because it has obvious
negative implications both for privacy and for the load on your system: an
attacker can run multiple copies of analog causing a denial-of-service attack.
There are more <a href="#security">notes on security design</a>
in this program towards the end of this section.

<p>
The form interface consists of two parts: a form (called
<kbd>anlgform.html</kbd>) to choose the options, and a cgi program (called
<kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd>) to pass them to the analog
program. Both <kbd>anlgform.html</kbd> and <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> <b>must</b>
be configured to your system before they will work at all. There are
instructions at the top of both files explaining how to do this.

<p>
The form which is distributed with the program should only be regarded as an
example form. You can find forms in languages other than English in the
<kbd>lang</kbd> directory. Or you can write your own if you prefer. In fact
you don't actually need the form at all: if you want just to create a link
to the cgi program, with the arguments passed after a question mark in the URL
in the usual way, then that's fine.

<hr size=1 noshade>
Almost every analog configuration command can be specified on the form, just
by including a form element with that name on the form. So, for example, if
you wanted to add a field for users to choose a logfile, you could write
<pre>
Logfile name: &lt;input type=text name="LOGFILE"&gt;
</pre>
or maybe something like
<pre>
&lt;select name=LOGFILE size=1&gt;
  &lt;option value="/var/log/apache/fred"&gt; Fred's logfile
  &lt;option value="/var/log/apache/jane"&gt; Jane's logfile
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>

<p>
There are a few commands which you can't specify on the form for security or
performance reasons. The full list is <kbd>*LOGFORMAT</kbd>,
<kbd>LANGFILE</kbd>, <kbd>DESCFILE</kbd>, <kbd>HEADERFILE</kbd>,
<kbd>FOOTERFILE</kbd>, <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd>, <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd>,
<kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd>, <kbd>ERRFILE</kbd>, <kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd>,
<kbd>DNS</kbd> and <kbd>SETTINGS</kbd>;
and the person setting up the form can add more. See the
<a href="#security">security notes</a> below for the reasons for these
exclusions, and for some more commands you might want to add to the forbidden
list. You can, if you prefer, specify the commands which are allowed, rather
than those which are forbidden.

<hr size=1 noshade>
Some commands are most conveniently specified in two halves. First, there are
commands which take two arguments (for example
<a href="alias.html"><kbd>ALIAS</kbd>es</a> or
<kbd><a href="logfile.html#secondarg">LOGFILE</a></kbd>). You can cope with
these by
sending two commands from the form, called <kbd>COMMAND1</kbd> and
<kbd>COMMAND2</kbd>. For example,
<pre>
Alias this file: &lt;input type=text name="FILEALIAS1"&gt;
To this one: &lt;input type=text name="FILEALIAS2"&gt;
</pre>
You can only specify one such pair this way, so there's no way to specify
several of the same <kbd>ALIAS</kbd>, for example. Only the last
<kbd>COMMAND1</kbd> and the last <kbd>COMMAND2</kbd> you specify count.

<p>
Then there are <a href="othreps.html#FLOOR"><kbd>FLOOR</kbd></a> commands. To
avoid users of the form having to know the syntax of these commands, you can
if you want specify them in two halves, <kbd>FLOORA</kbd> and
<kbd>FLOORB</kbd>, and they will be stuck together. For example, the form
distributed with the program specifies
<pre>
&lt;br&gt;Include all domains with at least
&lt;input type=TEXT name="DOMFLOORA" maxlength=6 size=6&gt;
&lt;select name="DOMFLOORB"&gt;
  &lt;option value=r&gt;requests
  &lt;option value=p&gt;requests for pages
  &lt;option value=b selected&gt;bytes
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>
If <kbd>DOMFLOORA</kbd> contains <kbd>5%</kbd> and <kbd>DOMFLOORB</kbd>
contains <kbd>r</kbd>, then <kbd>DOMFLOOR 5%r</kbd> will be sent to the
program. (Or <kbd>DOMFLOORA=5</kbd> and <kbd>DOMFLOORB=%r</kbd> would work
too, if you chose to present the form that way.)

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="formqv">There are a couple</a> of extra non-analog commands which can
be sent from the form. First, if the option <kbd>qv=1</kbd> is set, then
analog is not run, but a list of the configuration commands which would have
been sent to analog is printed instead. This is useful for checking that the
CGI program is working properly. It can also allow users to produce a
configuration file from form settings.

<p>
Secondly, you can specify other configuration files to be included at specific
times. When analog is called by the CGI program, it first processes the
<a href="syntax.html#specialcfgs">default configuration file</a> as usual.
Then it processes any configuration file specified by an option with name
<kbd>cg</kbd>. Then it processes all the other commands which the CGI program
specifies. After that, it processes any configuration file specified by an
option with name <kbd>cm</kbd>. Finally, it processes the
<a href="syntax.html#specialcfgs">mandatory configuration file</a> as usual.
(You may therefore want two copies of analog, one for form use and one for
non-form use, with different configuration files compiled in.) Note that
the commands in the default and mandatory configuration files will contribute
to the configuration: some of them may even override options specified on the
form. For example, if the default configuration file contains an
<kbd><a href="include.html">INCLUDE</a></kbd> command, this may cause
<kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands specified on the form to
behave unexpectedly.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> usually sends the commands to analog in the order in which
it received them, which should be the same as the order they occurred in the
form. But there are some exceptions. First, all commands of the same name are
grouped together. So an interleaved sequence of <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd>s and
<kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd>s won't work, for example. Secondly, even though the names
of commands are case-insensitive, commands of the same name but in different
cases may come in the wrong order. Keep them in the same case! Thirdly,
<kbd>WARNINGS</kbd> and <kbd>LOGTIMEOFFSET</kbd> are sent first (and thus the
<kbd>LOGTIMEOFFSET</kbd> applies to any logfiles specified on the form).

<p>
<a name="formalways">There are</a> a couple of commands which the form always
sets. These may override what you have set elsewhere. First, it sets either
<kbd>DNS READ</kbd> (if a <kbd>DNSFILE</kbd> is set on the form) or <kbd>DNS
NONE</kbd> (otherwise). Do <strong>not</strong> attempt to override this --
not only will you get timeout problems, but an attacker can then write to any
file by setting <kbd>DNSFILE</kbd>.
<p>
The second command which the form always sets is <kbd>WARNINGS FL</kbd>, so
that the less
important warnings don't fill up your server's error log. You can override
this by sending an explicit <kbd>WARNINGS</kbd> command from the form. And
thirdly, it sets <kbd>DEBUG -C</kbd> to avoid filling up the error log if the
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> is incorrectly configured: this can't be overridden from
the form, only from the mandatory configuration file.

<p>
<a name="formcharts">You won't get pie charts</a> on the form unless you set a
<kbd>CHARTDIR</kbd> and <kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> in your default configuration
file (<kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> is disabled from the form for security
reasons). And even if you do this, there will be a problem if two users try
and run the form interface at the same time, because they will be trying to
write the same images, so they may see broken images or each other's charts.

<p>
<a name="formuncompress">There is one small point</a> about compressed
logfiles. For security reasons, when using the form interface you need to
specify the full pathname to the uncompression command in the
<kbd><a href="logfile.html#UNCOMPRESS">UNCOMPRESS</a></kbd> command in your
configuration file.

<p>
<a name="formcharsets">Again for security reasons,</a> analog checks the input
from configuration commands more carefully when using the form interface
before outputting it. One side-effect of this is that the
<kbd>JAPANESE-JIS</kbd> character set won't work. Use one of the other
Japanese character sets instead.

<hr size=1 noshade><h3><a name="trouble">Form troubleshooting</a></h3>
Here is what to do if you are having problems setting up the form interface.

<p>
First, does analog run properly on its own without anlgform?

<p>
Next, you can run <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> from the (DOS or Unix) command
line. <em>This is good enough to debug most problems</em>. You can specify
options in pairs like this:
<pre>
anlgform.pl qv=1 LOGFILE=/some/log REQINCLUDE=pages
</pre>
If you include <kbd>qv=1</kbd> in the argument list as above, you will see
what <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> is trying to send to analog. If you don't include
<kbd>qv=1</kbd>, <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> will try and run analog.

<p>If it still doesn't work, check the following points:
<ol>
  <li>Have you edited <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> and <kbd>anlgform.html</kbd> as
      instructed at the top of those files?
  <li>Do other CGI programs work on your server? Is <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> in
      the right place to be recognised as a CGI program by the server?
  <li>Look in the server's error log for clues. You might want to set
      <kbd>WARNINGS ON</kbd> before you do this, because by default only
      warnings in categories <kbd>F</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> are reported.
  <li>Sometimes it's helpful to set the <kbd>ERRFILE</kbd> in your analog
      configuration file (it won't work from the form) to catch any errors and
      warnings which may be getting lost. This is especially true on IIS which
      incorrectly sends errors to the browser instead of to an error log. If
      you are using Internet Explorer you will probably also need to disable
      the &quot;friendly&quot; error messages so that you can see the actual
      error message.
  <li>Are all relevant files (analog itself, logfiles, configuration files,
      auxiliary files such as domain files...) executable/readable by your web
      server?
  <li>If some form options don't seem to take effect, then check whether they
      are being overridden by a command in a configuration file. (Although
      <kbd>SETTINGS</kbd> is forbidden from the form, you might find it useful
      to set it in your default configuration file.)
  <li>If you get a long wait, then no data returned, the server is probably
      timing out the request before analog has finished. The remedy is to
      increase the timeout interval.
  <li>As explained <a href="#formalways">above</a>, the form always sets
      <kbd>DNS READ</kbd> or <kbd>DNS NONE</kbd>, <kbd>WARNINGS FL</kbd>, and
      <kbd>DEBUG -C</kbd>,
      overriding your default configuration file.
  <li>Again as explained <a href="#formcharts">above</a>, pie charts may not
      appear or may appear wrongly.
  <li>Again as explained <a href="#formuncompress">above</a>,
      uncompressing of compressed logfiles doesn't work unless you use the
      full pathname in the <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> command.
  <li>And once again as explained <a href="#formcharsets">above</a>, the
      <kbd>JAPANESE-JIS</kbd> character set won't work from the form interface.
</ol>

<hr size=1 noshade><h3><a name="security">Security notes</a></h3>

As I said above, CGI programs can often contain security loopholes. (See the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/">World Wide Web Security FAQ</a> and
the <a href="http://www.go2net.com/people/paulp/cgi-security/safe-cgi.txt">CGI
Security FAQ</a> for more on this.) Although I
<a href="Licence.txt">don't guarantee</a> that the form interface is safe, I
have done my best to make it so. Here I shall explain my design decisions.
Comments on them are of course welcome: if they need to remain confidential,
you can email me privately at <kbd><a href="mailto:analog-author@lists.meer.net">analog-author@lists.meer.net</a></kbd>.
<p>
First, you should think about who can run the form interface. Unless you take
special measures like password protection or limiting <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd>
to specific hostnames, adding the form interface to your site implies making
analog executable, and your logfiles analysable, by anyone on the internet, as
often as they want. It's usually a bad idea to allow this, because
of the obvious concerns both about privacy and about the load on your
system. Unless you limit the total CPU available to any analog processes, it is
easy for an attacker to run multiple copies of analog, causing a
denial-of-service attack.
<p>
Certain commands are ignored by <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> and not passed to
analog. The list of them can be found at the top of <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd>.
Here are the reasons for them. <kbd>HEADERFILE</kbd> and <kbd>FOOTERFILE</kbd>
would place any file on your system within the output. The
<kbd>*LOGFORMAT</kbd> commands would also allow any file to be read, because
someone could designate each line to be a single filename and then just list
the filenames. <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd>, <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd>, <kbd>ERRFILE</kbd>
and <kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> would allow people to write to your filespace;
<kbd>ERRFILE</kbd> would also divert warnings away from your server's error
log. <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> would allow a user to execute any command.
<kbd>DNS</kbd> is forbidden because setting it higher than <kbd>READ</kbd>
would normally cause the process to time out, and also because with
<kbd>DNS WRITE</kbd>, the <kbd>DNSFILE</kbd> would be a file to write,
not just a file to read. <kbd>CGI</kbd> would allow the
user to generate syntactically incorrect output. <kbd>PROGRESSFREQ</kbd> would
allow a user to conduct a denial-of-service attack by filling up your error
log really, really fast (and <kbd>DEBUG C</kbd> is <a href="#formalways">also
disabled</a> for the same reason.) 
<p>
None of the above should be deleted (unless you are really, really sure that
it's completely impossible for anyone other than yourself to run
<kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd>). There are three other commands which are forbidden by
default but which you could consider removing from the forbidden list.
<kbd>SETTINGS</kbd> is included because it will give away the locations of
some files on your system. But it is useful for diagnostic purposes, and you
could consider removing it <em>temporarily</em> if you have trouble setting up
the form. The other commands which are included are <kbd>LANGFILE</kbd> and
<kbd>DESCFILE</kbd>. They are included because it is possible that another
file could be exactly the right number of lines long to be accepted as a
language file or report descriptions file, and then parts of it would get into
the output. But it would have to be exactly the right number of lines long
first. These commands shouldn't really be needed if your copy of analog is
installed correctly, because the <kbd>LANGUAGE</kbd> command should find the
right files. But if you want them, and you're prepared to take the risk
described above, you can remove <kbd>LANGFILE</kbd> and/or <kbd>DESCFILE</kbd>
from the list.
<p>
There are other commands which you might consider adding to the list. For
example, it is theoretically possible (though rather unlikely), that another
file on your system could conform sufficiently closely to one of the
predefined log formats that analog could be persuaded to analyse it and so
reveal some of its contents. If you're worried about this, or even if you want
to force only one particular logfile to be analysed from the form, you can add
the <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command to the list of forbidden commands. And you could
add <kbd>DOMAINSFILE</kbd> for similar reasons. Or if you wanted to stop a
user having control over which analog warnings were written to the error log,
you could add <kbd>WARNINGS</kbd> to the list. (Possible attempted security
violations detected by anlgform will always be written.)
<p>
You can of course add any command you like to the list. For example, 
a user can use any configuration file on your system unless you add
<kbd>CONFIGFILE</kbd>. If you add a command,
you must also add any aliases for it. Have a look in the source file
<kbd>globals.c</kbd> for the same command under different names -- some
commands have legacy names which I don't admit to in the documentation.
<p>
For more certainty, you can, if you prefer, configure anlgform so that you
specify the commands which are allowed, rather than those which are forbidden.
See the top of <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> for how to do this.
<hr size=1 noshade>
For those who know about CGI security issues, here are some more technical
comments on my design. <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> sets the <kbd>$PATH</kbd>
environment variable to be empty. It opens <kbd>analog</kbd> as a pipe in
order to pass arguments into analog's standard input. User-specified data is
not used for the <kbd>open()</kbd> function, only passed down the pipe.
<kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> is run with the <kbd>-T</kbd> flag on Unix. (Does
anyone know how to get this working under Windows?)
<p>
The arguments to <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> and <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd> commands are
checked for containing only certain allowed characters (specifically, letters,
digits, <kbd>/\.:_*?</kbd> space, and <kbd>-</kbd> between two {letter, digit,
underscore}'s). This is because they could match an <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd>
command and thus be passed to the shell when the uncompress command is
<kbd>popen()</kbd>'ed.
<p>
Apart from that, command names are checked for containing only letters and the
digits 1 and 2; and the arguments to commands are checked for not containing
control characters (actually characters 0-32 and 127-159; in particular
newline characters are prohibited). The length of the commands isn't checked
by <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd>, but buffer overflow shouldn't be an issue as
configuration commands are checked for length by analog.
<p>
<a name="notcgi">By the way</a>, the reason that I advise that analog itself
shouldn't be used as a CGI program is that some servers, notably Microsoft
IIS, allow users to pass command line arguments into a CGI program. And even
if the program doesn't return the proper CGI headers, the output can be sent
back to the user. This means that all the above checking of arguments is then
thwarted. Of course, on servers on which you can't pass command line arguments
to a CGI program, there are not the same security concerns, but then analog
isn't very useful as a CGI program because if you can't pass any arguments,
you can only get the default output.

<hr size=1 noshade><h3><a name="formtech">Technical details</a></h3>
You need to be running Perl 5.001 or later (unless you're on Windows and
download the executable version of the form interface from the
<a href="helpers.html">helper applications page</a>). You can get the latest
version of Perl free from <a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a> (or
from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/</a>
if you're on Windows). You also need the module
<kbd><a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CGI/">CGI.pm</a></kbd>,
but this should have come with Perl anyway.

<p>
On Windows, you have to associate the <kbd>.pl</kbd> extension with the Perl
executable so that Perl scripts are executed by Perl.

<p>
<kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd> will understand the <kbd>GET</kbd> or <kbd>POST</kbd>
methods of form submission. The
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.1">HTML
spec</a> says that <kbd>GET</kbd> should be used when, as in this case,
running the program has no side effects. However, section 15.1.3 of the
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt">HTTP spec</a> says that
<kbd>POST</kbd> should be used if some of the options being passed might be
confidential. Also, very long URLs, formed by specifying lots of options, can
cause trouble to some older servers. So <kbd>anlgform.html</kbd> uses the
<kbd>POST</kbd> method by default. However, the <kbd>GET</kbd> method will
also work. For example, you could make a normal link to <kbd>anlgform.pl</kbd>
with options specified after a question mark in the usual <kbd>GET</kbd> way.

<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog 6.0: Time reports</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

This section is about commands which control the appearance of the time
reports. There are thirteen such reports, which show the pattern of usage
over time. Eight of them (the ones with &quot;Report&quot; in their name) show
the usage at specific times, whilst the other five (the &quot;Summaries&quot;)
show the total (not average) activity at particular times of day and week over
the whole time period of the report.
<p>
By the way, in the following lists, don't get confused between the commands
for the Quarterly Report (which begin with <kbd>QUARTERLY</kbd>) and those for
the Quarter-Hour Report and Quarter-Hour Summary (with begin with
<kbd>QUARTERREP</kbd> and <kbd>QUARTERSUM</kbd> respectively).
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="timeCOLS">Each time report</a> can contain columns listing the
requests, requests for
pages, and bytes transferred at that time, using the following code letters.
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>R</kbd><dd>Number of requests
  <dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Percentage of the requests
  <dt><kbd>P</kbd><dd>Number of page requests
  <dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Percentage of the page requests
  <dt><kbd>B</kbd><dd>Number of bytes transferred
  <dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>Percentage of the bytes
</dl>
Which columns appear in which reports is controlled by various <kbd>COLS</kbd>
commands. For example, the command
<pre>
HOURSUMCOLS Pb
</pre>
tells analog to include the number of page requests and percentage of the
bytes, in that order, as the columns for the Hourly Summary. The full list of
these <kbd>COLS</kbd> commands is <kbd>YEARCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>QUARTERLYCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>MONTHCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>WEEKCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>DAYREPCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>DAYSUMCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>HOURREPCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>HOURSUMCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>WEEKHOURCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>QUARTERREPCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>QUARTERSUMCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>FIVEREPCOLS</kbd> and <kbd>FIVESUMCOLS</kbd>.
There is also a <kbd>TIMECOLS</kbd> command, which
specifies that all the time reports are to have the specified columns.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="GRAPH">Similarly</a>, analog can plot the bar charts in the time
reports according to
the number of requests, number of page requests, or number of bytes. This
is controlled by the <kbd>GRAPH</kbd> family of commands. So, for example,
<pre>
DAYREPGRAPH P
</pre>
tells analog to plot the bar charts in the Daily Report by the number of page
requests. This also controls how analog decides which is the busiest time
period in the bottom line of the report.
Using a lower case letter tells analog to plot the bar charts with
ASCII characters instead of the normal red bars. (This produces shorter
output, and it is how they appear anyway in <kbd>PLAIN</kbd> and
<kbd>ASCII</kbd> output styles,
or when viewed with a non-graphical browser.) So, for example,
<pre>
DAYREPGRAPH b
</pre>
would plot the Daily Report by bytes, without using the graphics. The full
list of <kbd>GRAPH</kbd> commands is <kbd>YEARGRAPH</kbd>,
<kbd>QUARTERLYGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>MONTHGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>WEEKGRAPH</kbd>,
<kbd>DAYREPGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>DAYSUMGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>HOURREPGRAPH</kbd>,
<kbd>HOURSUMGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>WEEKHOURGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>QUARTERREPGRAPH</kbd>,
<kbd>QUARTERSUMGRAPH</kbd>, <kbd>FIVEREPGRAPH</kbd> and
<kbd>FIVESUMGRAPH</kbd>.
There's also an
<kbd>ALLGRAPH</kbd> command to set all of them simultaneously.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="BARSTYLE">There are various</a> possible graphics available for the
graphs, controlled by
the <kbd>BARSTYLE</kbd> command, as follows. (They will all look the same if
you have a non-graphical browser.)
<pre><tt>
BARSTYLE a  <img src="bara8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE b  <img src="barb8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE c  <img src="barc8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE d  <img src="bard8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE e  <img src="bare8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE f  <img src="barf8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE g  <img src="barg8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE h  <img src="barh8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE i  <img src="bari8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
BARSTYLE j  <img src="barj8.gif" alt="+++++++++++">
</tt></pre>
The default style is <kbd>b</kbd>.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="BACK">You can plot the graphs</a> either forwards in time (starting
from the earliest
date) or backwards (starting from the latest date). Use commands
like
<pre>
MONTHBACK ON  # Monthly Report backwards
WEEKBACK OFF  # Weekly Report forwards
</pre>
The full list of <kbd>BACK</kbd> commands is <kbd>YEARBACK</kbd>,
<kbd>QUARTERLYBACK</kbd>, <kbd>MONTHBACK</kbd>, <kbd>WEEKBACK</kbd>,
<kbd>DAYREPBACK</kbd>, <kbd>HOURREPBACK</kbd>, <kbd>QUARTERREPBACK</kbd> and
<kbd>FIVEREPBACK</kbd>.
It tends to be confusing to mix directions (and analog will warn you if you
attempt it) so usually you want to use the <kbd>ALLBACK</kbd> command which
will set all of them at once.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="ROWS">For the more detailed time reports</a>, you usually only want
to list the last
few time periods. (Every five minutes for the last three years?? I think not.)
So analog provides some <kbd>ROWS</kbd> commands to let you specify how many
rows you want in the time reports. For example
<pre>
QUARTERREPROWS 96  # only the last day's worth
MONTHROWS 0        # 0 means no restriction: show all time
</pre>
The full list of <kbd>ROWS</kbd> commands is <kbd>YEARROWS</kbd>,
<kbd>QUARTERLYROWS</kbd>, <kbd>MONTHROWS</kbd>, <kbd>WEEKROWS</kbd>,
<kbd>DAYREPROWS</kbd>, <kbd>HOURREPROWS</kbd>, <kbd>QUARTERREPROWS</kbd> and
<kbd>FIVEREPROWS</kbd>.
Even if a <kbd>ROWS</kbd> command is given, the line at the bottom of the
report will still show the busiest time period ever, not just the busiest
one in that many rows.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="MARKCHAR">The character</a> which is used for plotting the graphs in
<kbd>PLAIN</kbd> and <kbd>ASCII</kbd> styles or on a
non-graphical browser is specified by means of the <kbd>MARKCHAR</kbd>
command. For example,
<pre>
MARKCHAR =
</pre>
tells analog to use the equals sign.
<p>
<a name="MINGRAPHWIDTH">There is a parameter</a> called
<kbd>MINGRAPHWIDTH</kbd> which sets the minimum
nominal size of the graphs. For example, if you set
<pre>
MINGRAPHWIDTH 10
</pre>
then the graph will be allowed to be up to 10 characters wide, even if
that would exceed the <kbd>PAGEWIDTH</kbd>.
<p>
<a name="WEEKBEGINSON">There is one more command</a> which affects the time
reports. You can specify
which day should be counted as the first day of the week. This affects the
layout of the Daily Report, Daily Summary, Weekly Report and Hour of the Week
Summary. For example, our local student newspaper publishes a new edition on
the web every Friday, so they like to specify
<kbd>
WEEKBEGINSON FRIDAY
</kbd>
for their reports.

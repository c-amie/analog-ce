<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0:
Computer-readable output style</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

This section describes the computer-readable output style. You can select
this style by the command
<pre>
OUTPUT COMPUTER
</pre>
This style is designed to be easy to read into spreadsheets, or post-process
with graphics creation tools, for example. You can find some programs which
use this style on the <a href="helpers.html">helper applications</a> page.
However, the computer-readable output style is not suitable for reading back
into analog to create later reports: for that job, use the
<a href="cache.html">cache files</a> described in the next section.

<p>
Each line in the output is separated into fields by means of a special string.
You can specify this string by means of the <kbd>COMPSEP</kbd> command; for
example, you could use
<pre>
COMPSEP ,
</pre>
for CSV (comma separated value) format. Or you can use
<pre>
COMPSEP \t
</pre>
to separate fields with a tab. Make sure not to use anything that
might occur in the output: for example, a single or double space would not be
suitable.

<hr size=1 noshade>
Each line in the preformatted output begins with a letter indicating which
report the line is part of. (The code letters for the reports are listed in
the section on <cite><a href="output.html#replist">Configuring the
Output</a></cite>.)
<p>
After that, there follows a field indicating the remaining columns in the
report (using the letters <kbd>RrSsPpQqBbCcDdEeN</kbd> as usual). In
<a href="hierreps.html">hierarchical reports</a> (including the reports which
can show search arguments) there is an additional column <kbd>l</kbd> at the
beginning, indicating the level in the hierarchy.
<p>
Finally there are the numerical data for each column and then the name of the
item. Times actually take up several fields: year, month, date, hour &amp;
minute, or as many of those as are necessary to identify the time. (Year and
quarter in the case of the Quarterly Report).
<p>
So here is an example line from the Domain Report, showing the third-level
domain <kbd>cam.ac.uk</kbd> with 43 requests and 3.516% of the bytes.
<pre>o     lRb     3     43     3.516     cam.ac.uk</pre>

<hr size=1 noshade>
The last line of most time reports indicates the busiest time period. After the
report letter comes <kbd>*BT</kbd>, followed by the letter <kbd>R</kbd>,
<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>B</kbd> for the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#GRAPH">GRAPH</a></kbd> method, followed by the
number of requests, pages or bytes respectively for the busiest time period,
followed by the time period itself.
<p>
The first lines of non-time reports can also contain overall information about
the report. First, if the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#REPORTSPAN">REPORTSPAN</a></kbd> for the report is
wanted, it will be listed in lines with <kbd>*FR</kbd> and <kbd>*LR</kbd>
instead of the normal column letters. Then there is a line listing the floor
and sortby for the report. It has <kbd>*f</kbd> instead of the normal
column letters, followed by the floor in the form it would be written
for a <kbd><a href="othreps.html#FLOOR">FLOOR</a></kbd> command, followed by
the <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> using the code letters
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd><kbd>REQUESTS</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd><kbd>REQUESTS</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd><kbd>PAGES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd><kbd>PAGES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd><kbd>BYTES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>c</kbd><dd><kbd>BYTES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd><kbd>DATE</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd><kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd><kbd>RANDOM</kbd>
</dl>

<hr size=1 noshade>
The general summary is a bit different. After an initial <kbd>x</kbd>, there is
a two-character code saying what the line contains. The possible codes are
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>VE</kbd><dd>Version of analog
  <dt><kbd>HN</kbd><dd><kbd>HOSTNAME</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>HU</kbd><dd><kbd>HOSTURL</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>PS</kbd><dd>Program start time
  <dt><kbd>FR</kbd><dd>Time of first request
  <dt><kbd>LR</kbd><dd>Time of last request
  <dt><kbd>E7</kbd><dd>Time last 7 days ends
  <dt><kbd>SR</kbd><dd>Total successful requests
  <dt><kbd>S7</kbd><dd>Total successful requests in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>PR</kbd><dd>Total successful requests for pages
  <dt><kbd>P7</kbd><dd>Total successful requests for pages in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>FL</kbd><dd>Total failed requests
  <dt><kbd>F7</kbd><dd>Total failed requests in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>RR</kbd><dd>Total redirected requests
  <dt><kbd>R7</kbd><dd>Total redirected requests in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>NC</kbd><dd>Logfile lines without status code
  <dt><kbd>C7</kbd><dd>Lines without status code in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>NF</kbd><dd>Number of distinct files requested
  <dt><kbd>N7</kbd><dd>Number of distinct files requested in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>NH</kbd><dd>Number of distinct hosts served
  <dt><kbd>H7</kbd><dd>Number of distinct hosts served in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>CL</kbd><dd>Number of corrupt lines in the logfile
  <dt><kbd>UL</kbd><dd>Number of unwanted lines in the logfile
  <dt><kbd>BT</kbd><dd>Total number of bytes transferred
  <dt><kbd>B7</kbd><dd>Total number of bytes transferred in last 7 days
</dl>

Which lines are listed is still controlled by the
<kbd><a href="output.html#GENSUMLINES">GENSUMLINES</a></kbd> command. This
implies that if you turn a line off, you turn off its &quot;last 7 days&quot;
version too.

<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0: Cache files</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

Analog has the ability to archive <strong>some</strong> of the data in your
logfile into a <i>cache file</i> so that the logfile can be thrown away
without losing the most important data. (This is sometimes known as
<i>incremental processing</i>.)

<p>
For most people, the cache file will not be needed: compressing
the logfile using a standard compression utility such as gzip will be
sufficient. Compressing a logfile is very efficient owing to the large number
of repeated strings: I find about 12 times compression in practice. That in
itself may solve your filespace problems, without needing to throw away any
information.

<p>
The cache file is also not the best format for post-processing the data or
feeding it into a spreadsheet. For that you should use the
<a href="compout.html">computer-readable output style</a>.

<p>
Many people have trouble using the cache file, and end up accidentally
recording corrupt data. You do need to understand what you're doing before you
throw away your logfiles. See the discussion on
<a href="#cacheproc">Procedures</a> below.

<p>
If you are going to use the cache file feature, it is also very important that
you understand what is and what is not recorded.
The summary is that all <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands,
including <kbd>FROM</kbd> and <kbd>TO</kbd>, and any <kbd>ALIAS</kbd>es and
<kbd>LOGTIMEOFFSET</kbd>s, <strong>must</strong> be applied when you
<em>create</em> the cache file, not when you read it later. If you want
different sets of options, you must create several cache files from the same
logfile.
<p>
The reason for this is that it is <strong>not</strong>
possible to reconstruct everything of interest in the logfile from the cache
file. The cache file does contain information about the total number of
requests for each host and each file, but not about, for example, which files
were read by which hosts. (To do so would take up as much disk space as the
compressed logfile.) So you cannot later look at only one file and see which
hosts read that file.
<p>
Another way to look at this: if you do, for example, a <kbd>HOSTEXCLUDE</kbd>
when reading the cache file, you are not doing a genuine
<kbd>HOSTEXCLUDE</kbd> because files that that host read will still be
included. You are only excluding those hosts from the Host Report,
Organisation Report and Domain Report. This is why you must do all the
inclusions and exclusions you want when you create the cache file.
<p>
When analog reads in a cache file, it does not apply any more aliases to the
items. This is to avoid double-aliasing.
So you must do any aliases you want at the time
you create the cache file. Similarly, it does not obey the
<kbd><a href="output.html#TIMEOFFSET">LOGTIMEOFFSET</a></kbd> variable, to
avoid
double-offsetting, so any offset you want must be applied at cache-creation
time too.
<p>
Also, the cache file does not contain data about the number of requests for
each item in the last seven days: it can't, because the figures will be
different by the time they are wanted.
<p>
Finally, times are only recorded to five-minute resolution.

<hr size=1 noshade>
You can create a cache file by setting the <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> to be
the file you want the cache to live in. Set
<pre>
CACHEOUTFILE none
</pre>
to turn it off again. You will still get the regular output as well as the
cache output, unless you request <kbd><a href="output.html#outstyle">OUTPUT
NONE</a></kbd>. To avoid overwriting, you cannot set the
<kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> to be a file which already exists. (Disclaimer: on
some systems, race conditions may very occasionally thwart this check. Also
on a few systems, making the file writeable but not readable will allow it to
be overwritten). You can include the date in the name of the
<kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd> and <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> in the same way as
<a href="logfile.html#datecodes">described earlier</a> for the
<kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> and <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd>.

<p>
You can read in a previously-made cache file with the <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd>
command, or with the <kbd>+U</kbd> command line option. This works exactly the
same as the
<kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFILE</a></kbd> command, so you can use commas
and wildcards to read in several cache files, and read compressed cache
files using the <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> mechanism.

<p>
If the name of the <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd> or the <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> doesn't
include a directory, it will be looked for, or written to, wherever analog
expects to find its cache files. (This location is built in when the program
is compiled.) For example, on Windows it would be in the same folder as the
analog executable. But a cache file specified in a <kbd>+U</kbd> command line
option is within the current directory.

<p>
It is possible (and useful) to analyse some <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd>s and some
<kbd>LOGFILE</kbd>s together. <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> and <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd>
commands are basically cumulative, except that any logfiles and cache files in
the <a href="syntax.html#specialcfgs">mandatory configuration file</a> or
configuration files loaded from there override any on the command line or in
configuration files specified on the command line, which themselves
override any in the <a href="syntax.html#specialcfgs">default configuration
file</a> or configuration files loaded from there, which in turn override
compile-time options.
Usually you don't need to worry about this, and it will do what you expect.

<p>
Sometimes you don't want to record all the types of item in the cache file.
You might want to forget about which hosts had accessed your web site, for
example, and only remember how many times each file was requested. You can
choose not to include one type of item in the cache file by setting its
<kbd><a href="lowmem.html">LOWMEM</a></kbd> to 3; for example, specify
<pre>
HOSTLOWMEM 3
</pre>
to exclude hosts from the cache file. Because this is a serious
step, analog will produce a warning if you do this. You can even set all six
<kbd>LOWMEM</kbd>s to 3 if you just want to remember the pattern of requests
over time, not even which files were requested.

<h3><a name="cacheproc">Procedures</a></h3>

Many people have trouble when they try and use cache files, and end up
omitting data or double-counting. You have to be careful to make sure that
each piece of data is recorded in exactly one cache file. One very common
mistake is to use all the old cache files when making each new cache file.
Because each piece of data is then in all of the cache files, when you make a
new cache file, it will record each piece of data several times over. If analog
gives you a &quot;double-counting&quot; warning when you create a cache file,
you have probably done something of this sort wrong.
<p>
Here is one way to use the cache files correctly. It's not the only correct
way, but I think it's conceptually the simplest. The idea is that whenever you
start a new logfile, you make a cache file out of the old logfile. So each
cache file contains all the data from one, and only one, logfile. You never
use old cache files to make new ones: so you never have a <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd>
and a <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> command in the same configuration file.
<p>
Here is the procedure.
<ol>
  <li>Rotate your logs: that means, archive the old logfile, and restart the
      server with a fresh logfile. (There are several standard tools to do
      this: or see your server documentation.)
  <li>Make both a cache file and an ordinary report from the old logfile. You
      can do this simultaneously by using one <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command, one
      <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> command, and one <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> command.
  <li>Make a test report from the cache file (using <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd>
      and <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> but no <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd>) and compare
      it against the report from the logfile to check it works. (This step
      really is worth doing!)
  <li>Now you can throw away the old logfile, if you've really understood what
      data you're losing by doing so. (But please remember that I can take no
      responsibility if something goes wrong: see the
      <a href="Licence.txt">licence</a>.)
  <li>When you want to make the main report, you can now use all your cache
      files and the current (not-yet-cached) logfile.
</ol>

As explained above, all <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands,
including <kbd>FROM</kbd> and <kbd>TO</kbd>, and any <kbd>ALIAS</kbd>es and
<kbd>LOGTIMEOFFSET</kbd>s, must be applied when you create the cache file, not
when you read it later. So you may want to create several cache files from each
logfile with different sets of options. Of course, in this case, you musn't
later mix cache files made with different options.

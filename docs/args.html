<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0: Search arguments</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

Sometimes a URL contains arguments after a question mark. For example, the URL
<pre>
/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2
</pre>
runs the <kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> program with arguments <kbd>x=1</kbd>
and <kbd>y=2</kbd>. (Sometimes the server records these arguments in a separate
field in the logfile, but if so you can use the <kbd>%q</kbd> field in the
<kbd><a href="logfmt.html#fmtstrings">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> command, and analog
will translate the filename to the above format).
<p>
You can tell analog either to read or to ignore the arguments using the
commands <kbd>ARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>ARGSEXCLUDE</kbd> which we'll discuss
<a href="#ARGSINCLUDE">in a minute</a>. But by default, all arguments are
read, and as this is usually what you want, you don't usually need those
commands.
<p>
You don't always see the arguments in the reports, even if they're being
read, because analog doesn't show them if there aren't enough of them. In
order to see them, you have to set the corresponding
<kbd><a href="hierreps.html#ARGSFLOOR">ARGSFLOOR</a></kbd> parameter low
enough.
<p>
Also note that within a report, the search arguments are listed immediately
under the file to which they refer. This temporarily interrupts the normal
order of the files. It may be clearer if you turn the
<a href="othreps.html#othCOLS"><kbd>N</kbd> column</a> on.
<hr size=1 noshade>
Assuming that the arguments are being read, analog treats the file
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2</kbd> as a different file from
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> (or from
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?y=2&amp;x=1</kbd> for that matter). It doesn't look
like that in the Request Report because you see a grand total for
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> with all its different arguments. But it matters
if you want to do <a href="include.html">inclusions and exclusions</a> or
<a href="alias.html#useraliases">aliases</a> on the file.
<p>
<a name="unintuitive">The reason</a> is that, for example, the command
<pre>
FILEINCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl
</pre>
<em>doesn't</em> match the file <kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2</kbd>. To
match that, you would have to use something like
<pre>
FILEINCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl*
</pre>
instead. Similarly
<pre>
FILEALIAS /cgi-bin/script.pl /script.pl
</pre>
will change <kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> itself, but not
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2</kbd>. You might want to use something
like
<pre>
FILEALIAS /cgi-bin/script.pl?* /script.pl?$1
</pre>
as well. (However, <kbd>PAGEINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>PAGEEXCLUDE</kbd> always
refer to the part of the filename before the question mark.)
<p>
Conversely, because in the Request Report files with arguments are only
included if their parent file is included, you can't just
<pre>
REQINCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl?*x=1*
</pre>
or you will end up with nothing listed. You have to
<pre>
REQINCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl
</pre>
as well.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="ARGSINCLUDE">The alternative</a> is to tell analog not to read the
search arguments. There are commands called <kbd>ARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>ARGSEXCLUDE</kbd>, and <kbd>REFARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REFARGSEXCLUDE</kbd>, to do this. They work the same as the
<a href="include.html">other <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd></a>
commands which we discussed in the previous section. So, for example, if the
command
<pre>
ARGSEXCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl
</pre>
were given, analog would ignore the arguments to that file, and so read
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2</kbd> as just
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd>. On the other hand, if
<pre>
ARGSINCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl
</pre>
were specified, analog would read the arguments, and so treat
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2</kbd> as a different file from
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd>.
<kbd>REFARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>REFARGSEXCLUDE</kbd> are the same
for referrers.
<p>
Technical note: the check for whether the arguments should be included happens
before the filename has been subject to either built-in or user-specified
<a href="alias.html">aliases</a>. So you have to use the unaliased name,
exactly as it occurs in the logfile. For example,
<kbd>ARGSINCLUDE&nbsp;/~sret1/script.pl</kbd> won't match
<kbd>/%7Esret1/script.pl</kbd> even though they are really the same
file. It also means that you can't use &quot;<kbd>pages</kbd>&quot; in the
<kbd>ARGSINCLUDE</kbd> or <kbd>ARGSEXCLUDE</kbd> command, because we don't
know whether a file is a page until after it's been aliased.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="SEARCHENGINE">There are related commands</a> called
<kbd>SEARCHENGINE</kbd> and <kbd>INTSEARCHENGINE</kbd>. If you have referrers
with search arguments, usually
from search engines, you can tell analog which field corresponds to the search
term. It uses this information to compile the Search Query Report and the
Search Word Report. For example, consider the referrer
<pre>
http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&amp;kl=XX&amp;q=carrot+cake
</pre>
The search term is in the field <kbd>q=</kbd> so the appropriate
<kbd>SEARCHENGINE</kbd> command is
<pre>
SEARCHENGINE http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query q
</pre>
(or even better
<pre>
SEARCHENGINE http://*altavista.*/* q
</pre>
to allow for all their mirror sites in different countries.)
<p>
The command <kbd>INTSEARCHENGINE</kbd> is the same for search engines, or
other scripts which take arguments, within your site. For example, you might
have requests for files like
<pre>
/cgi-bin/search?trm=chocolate+cake
</pre>
in which case you would specify
<pre>
INTSEARCHENGINE /cgi-bin/search trm
</pre>
and (assuming you haven't done an
<kbd><a href="#ARGSINCLUDE">ARGSEXCLUDE</a></kbd> for that file)
&quot;chocolate cake&quot; would then appear in your Internal Search Query
Report.
<p>
Sometimes a search engine has two or more possible fields for the search
term. In that case you can list all of them separated by commas, like this:
<pre>
SEARCHENGINE http://*webcrawler.*/* search,searchText
</pre>
<hr size=1 noshade>
The rest of this section is a bit technical, and you usually don't need to
worry about it. On a first reading, you probably want to
<a href="output.html">skip it</a>.
<p>
<a name="SCC">I said</a> <a href="alias.html#DIRSUFFIX">previously</a> that
<kbd>%7E</kbd> in a URL is automatically converted to <kbd>~</kbd>, etc. In
fact this is only done to the ASCII-printable characters <kbd>%20-%7E</kbd>,
because these are the only characters that are the same in every character
set. (In fact, even that isn't true. Experts might want to know that
<kbd>?</kbd>, <kbd>&amp;</kbd>, <kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>=</kbd> aren't converted
either, to
distinguish them from query-string delimiters: an encoded <kbd>?</kbd>,
<kbd>&amp;</kbd>, <kbd>;</kbd> or <kbd>=</kbd> is one that is not intended to
be a delimiter. Also <kbd>%</kbd> isn't converted, to avoid confusing
<kbd>%25nm</kbd> with <kbd>%nm</kbd>.)
<p>
But in the Search Query Report and Search Word Report it is useful to be able
to convert non-ASCII characters too, so that you can see the actual words
people typed, rather than get the <kbd>%nm</kbd> codes in place of all
accented letters. So in these reports analog also converts characters
<kbd>%A0-%FF</kbd> (if you are using an ISO-8859-* character set) or
<kbd>%80-%FF</kbd> (for most other character sets).
<p>
However, there are reasons why you might not want this feature, and you can
turn it off with the command
<pre>
SEARCHCHARCONVERT OFF
</pre>
These reasons include:
<ol>
  <li>The character set in which the query was submitted to the search engine
      may not be the same as that in which the page reached was written, or
      that in which the analog output page is being written. So converting to
      the character set of the analog output page may give garbage anyway.
      This is particularly a problem with languages, such as Russian,
      which have two or more characters sets in common use. It is also a
      problem for sites which host resources in many languages.
  <li>Not all of the character positions correspond to printable characters in
      every character set. Analog knows that <kbd>%80-%9F</kbd> are
      non-printable in the ISO-8859-* character sets, but apart from that it
      converts everything in <kbd>%80-%FF</kbd>. So you may end up with
      non-printable characters in your output.
</ol>
<kbd>SEARCHCHARCONVERT</kbd> is always turned off if the output is in ASCII;
and it defaults to off if the output is in a multibyte character set because it
doesn't work well in that case.

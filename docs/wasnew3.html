      <kbd><a href="logfmt.html#Apache">APACHELOGFORMAT</a></kbd> and

      main report.
      <br>Lines without a particular item now work properly with

  <dt><b><a name="new290b1">2.90beta1</a></b> (27-Mar-98)
  <dd>This version is a completely rewritten version. Every single line of
      code is new. The whole code is shorter despite considerable improvements
      in functionality. Several people have reported that it is significantly
      faster. The most important new features are:
      <ul>
	<li>Eleven new reports (Quarter-Hour, Five-Minute, Redirection,
	    Failure, File Size, Referring Site, Redirected Referrer, Failed
	    Referrer, Virtual Host, User, User Failure).
	<li>Reads logfiles in user-customisable format.
	<li>Analyses user and virtual host data, and failed requests.
	<li>Hierarchical reports list subdirectories under directories, and
	    allow analysis of browser version numbers.
	<li>Faster sorting of long reports.
	<li>Floor and sort method made independent.
	<li>&quot;Last date&quot; column in reports, and can floor and sort by
	    date.
	<li>Busiest time period at bottom of time reports.
	<li>&quot;Not listed&quot; line at bottom of other report.
	<li>Knows HTTP/1.1 status codes.
	<li>General Summary can go anywhere in the report.
	<li>General Summary and &quot;Go To&quot;s can now be turned on and
	    off independently.
	<li>Status Code Report can be sorted in different ways.
	<li><a href="output.html#TIMEOFFSET">Time offset</a> commands.
	<li>Much better checking of invalid configuration options and invalid
	    logfile lines.
	<li>Only reads logfiles it might need.
	<li>Improvements in DNS functionality: can now read the DNS file
	    without further lookups: also, separate recheck intervals for
	    successful and failed lookups.
	<li>Hash sizes now chosen automatically.
	<li>More flexible language support.
	<li>Mac version reads gzipped logfiles.
	<li>Mac version supports drag-and-drop onto program icon.
	<li>Readme files completely re-written. Broken into lots of files,
	    and new sections on <cite><a href="start.html">Starting to use
	    analog</a></cite> and <cite><a href="meaning.html">What the
	    results mean</a></cite>, as well as an
	    <a href="indx.html">index</a>.
      </ul>
      <a name="abolished290b1">The following features</a> have been abolished.
      <ul>
	<li>No Error Report. The error log was always intended for humans
	    rather than computers to read. Moreover, its format varied from
	    server to server, and even between different versions of the same
	    server. The place of the Error Report has largely been taken by
	    the new reports, particularly the Failure Report.
	<li>The approximate host counting has been abolished for the time
	    being. I can put it back if there is a significant demand for it.
	<li>Only one <kbd>*</kbd> can now appear on the left-hand side of
	    aliases. This is to avoid ambiguities.
	<li>For changes in the names and syntax of configuration options and
	    command line arguments, see the section about
	    <a href="update.html">upgrading</a>.
      </ul>
      The following features are not yet present, but will be added by
      version 3.
      <ul>
	<li>The form interface.
	<li>Most of the languages.
      </ul>

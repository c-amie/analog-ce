<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog 6.0: Choosing a logfile</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

The basic command for selecting a logfile is
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename
</pre>
or just to put the logfile name on the command line without any arguments,
e.g., <kbd>analog logfilename</kbd>. In the Mac version, you can also analyse
a particular single logfile by dragging it onto the analog icon.
All logfiles must be within your computer's
file system (on disk, or at least mounted under Unix, or on a mapped drive
under NT) -- analog won't use FTP or HTTP to fetch them from the internet.

<p>
A <kbd>-</kbd> sign or the word <kbd>stdin</kbd> is interpreted as standard
input: this is useful on Unix systems for constructing pipes. There is also an
optional second argument to the <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command which is explained
<a href="#secondarg">below</a>.

<p>
You can have several <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> commands. You can include wildcards in
the logfile name (but not necessarily in the directory name: this is
system-dependent), and you can use a list of logfiles separated by commas
(without spaces). So the following commands would tell analog to read
<kbd>logfile1</kbd>, <kbd>c:\logs\logfile2</kbd>, and all files ending in
<kbd>.log</kbd>:
<pre>
LOGFILE logfile1,*.log
LOGFILE c:\logs\logfile2
</pre>
Or if you were on a Mac, you might use something like
<pre>
LOGFILE "Hard Drive:Internet Applications:Analog:Logs:*"
</pre>
You can also use the special command
<pre>
LOGFILE none
</pre>
to erase the list of logfiles specified so far.
<p>
If the name of a logfile in a <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command doesn't include a
directory, it will be looked for wherever analog expects to find logfiles.
(This location is built in when the program is compiled.) For example, on
Windows it would be in the same folder as the analog executable.
But logfile names given on the command line are within the current directory.
<p>
<a name="datecodes">You can also include the date</a> in the
<kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> name, by using the following codes.
<pre>
%D  date of month
%m  month name, in English
%M  month number
%y  two-digit year
%Y  four-digit year
%H  hour
%n  minute
%w  day of week, in English
</pre>
So for example,
<pre>
LOGFILE access_log%Y%M.log
</pre>
will look for the logfile <kbd>access_log200109.log</kbd>, if it's September
2001. The date used is actually the
<kbd><a href="include.html#FROMTO">TO</a></kbd> date if one was specified, and
otherwise the time of the start of the program. So for example, you can look
at all of last month's logfiles with the commands
<pre>
TO -00-0131                   # to end of last month
LOGFILE access_log%Y%M??.log  # finds access_log200108??.log in Sep 2001
</pre>
<p>
The <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> commands are cumulative, except that any logfiles
on the command line or in configuration files specified on the command line
override any in the <a href="syntax.html#specialcfgs">default configuration
file</a> or configuration files loaded from there, and are themselves
overridden by any in the <a href="syntax.html#specialcfgs">mandatory
configuration file</a> or configuration files loaded from there.
Usually you don't need to worry about this, and it will do what you expect!
(Actually I should have said &quot;logfiles or cache files&quot; -- but we'll
get on to that <a href="cache.html">later</a>).

<hr size=1 noshade>
Analog knows about several different types of logfile. By default it will
attempt to see if your logfile is of one of the types it knows about, based
on the first line. The types it can usually diagnose are the common log
format, the NCSA combined format, referrer log and browser log, the W3
extended log format, the Microsoft IIS format, the Netscape format, the
WebSTAR format, the WebSite format and the MacHTTP format.
<a href="#formats">Examples of all
these formats</a> are given at the end of this section. If you have
<a href="debug.html#debugs">debugging</a> on, analog will report what type of
logfile it thinks yours is.

<p>
If your logfile is not in one of the standard formats, you will probably still
be OK, because it is possible to tell analog about other formats using a
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command. This is explained in the
<a href="logfmt.html">next section</a>. But most users don't
ever need to know about this because they have logfiles in a standard
format. So the best thing to do is just to try analysing your logfile and see
if analog will understand it. If it does, you don't need to worry about
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd>s.

<p>
<a name="corruptlines">If analog can't understand</a> your logfile, it will
warn you that it can't detect
the format, or possibly that it found a lot of corrupt lines. There are
basically five reasons why this might happen:
<ol>
  <li>Many people try and use a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command when they don't
      need one. Always try without one first.
  <li>Some log formats are not very well designed and analog can't analyse
      them reliably. In this case it will give up, usually with a helpful
      message, rather than risk doing a bad job. For example, you might get
      &quot;<em>Logfile with ambiguous dates</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>Time
      without date</em>.&quot; In this case you should read the
      <a href="#formats">notes on all the built-in formats</a> below where
      some common problems with those formats are described.
  <li>Since analog tries to deduce the format based on the first line of the
      logfile, it could just be that the first line is corrupt. In this case,
      you could tell analog the format, or you could just fix the first line.
  <li>For the same reason, if the format changes midway through the log,
      analog will count the remaining lines as corrupt. In this case, you will
      find that your output page contains a partial analysis but with a large
      number of corrupt lines too. You will need to give analog two
      <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> commands to tell it about the two different formats.
  <li>Finally, some logfiles really aren't in one of the standard formats.
      In this case you will need to <a href="logfmt.html">read the next
      section</a> and learn how to tell analog about your format.
</ol>
If you can't see what's wrong with your logfile, you can specify
<kbd><a href="debug.html#debugs">DEBUG ON</a></kbd>, and analog will report
where each line was corrupt.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="secondarg">There is also an optional second argument</a> to the
<kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command, which specifies a
prefix to add to all the filenames in that logfile. This is useful if
you've got several different servers or virtual hosts, when the same
filename may occur on each of the servers.
For example,
<pre>
LOGFILE mydomain.log http://www.mydomain.com
</pre>
would translate a filename <kbd>/file.html</kbd> in <kbd>mydomain.log</kbd> to
<kbd>http://www.mydomain.com/file.html</kbd>. (If you only have logfiles from
one server, and you just want the prefix so that you can host the output on
a different server, then you probably want the
<a href="othreps.html#BASEURL"><kbd>BASEURL</kbd></a> command instead.)

<p>
Note that because this actually changes the name of the file, any
<kbd><a href="include.html">FILEINCLUDE</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="include.html">FILEEXCLUDE</a></kbd> or
<kbd><a href="alias.html#useraliases">FILEALIAS</a></kbd> command will have to
refer to the new name, including the prefix.

<p>
If you are using this command to combine logfiles from several different
virtual hosts, then the Virtual Host Report doesn't tell you about the
different virtual hosts. The virtual host name has just become part of the
filename. So you want to look in the Directory Report instead. (And you will
probably want to use the <kbd><a href="hierreps.html">SUBDIR</a></kbd> command
as well.)

<p>
If the logfile contains the name of the virtual host on each line, then the
argument can contain a <kbd>%v</kbd>, and the name of the virtual host will
be inserted at that point. If <kbd>%v</kbd> is included and the logfile line
doesn't have a virtual host, then that line will be marked as corrupt.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="UNCOMPRESS">It is often convenient</a> to store logfiles compressed
to save disk space.
Analog will automatically read logfiles compressed using gzip, zip or bzip2.
But if you have
logfiles compressed using some other program, analog can still read them
provided that you use an <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> command to say how to
uncompress them.
<p>
You need to supply the types of file that you want to
uncompress in a comma-separated list, together with the name of a command that
will uncompress the files to standard output (rather than to a file). For
example, on Unix you might use
<pre>
UNCOMPRESS *.Z "/usr/bin/uncompress -c"
</pre>
whereas on Windows NT, you might use
<pre>
UNCOMPRESS *.Z ("c:\Program Files\uncompress\uncompress" -c)
</pre>
<p>
If analog determines that a logfile which it's uncompressing isn't wanted for
the analysis, a &quot;broken pipe&quot; error can be reported. This is
produced by the uncompressing command and is out of analog's control, but it's
harmless.
<p>
(Hint: There's nothing to stop you using the <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> command for
other types of preprocessing, for example DNS resolution.)

<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3><a name="formats">Logfile</a> formats</h3>

Here is a summary of the various logfile formats which analog knows about.
To illustrate them, I have used the same (fictional) request as it might be
recorded in the different formats.

<p>
<a name="commonfmt">The common</a> logfile format is written by most
servers. Its lines look like
<pre>
jay.bird.com - fred [25/Dec/1998:17:45:35 +0000]
"GET /~sret1/ HTTP/1.0" 200 1243
</pre>
(except all on one line).
Some versions of Microsoft software have a buggy version of this with an extra
quote mark before the <kbd>HTTP</kbd> like this:
<pre>
jay.bird.com - fred [25/Dec/1998:17:45:35 +0000]
"GET /~sret1/ "HTTP/1.0" 200 1243
</pre>
Analog will understand these, but (as with any two formats) it will reject
lines if the format changes half way through.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="reffmt">The NCSA referrer log</a> looks like
<pre>
[25/Dec/1998:17:45:35] http://www.site.com/ -> /~sret1/
</pre>
<a name="browfmt">and the browser (or agent) log</a> looks like
<pre>
[25/Dec/1998:17:45:35] Mozilla/2.0 (X11; I; HP-UX A.09.05)
</pre>
In the referrer log, the date can be omitted.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="combinedfmt">The NCSA combined log</a> is the same as the common log,
except that
it has the referrer and browser on the end in quotes, like this:
<pre>
jay.bird.com - fred [25/Dec/1998:17:45:35 +0000] "GET /~sret1/ HTTP/1.0"
200 1243 "http://www.site.com/" "Mozilla/2.0 (X11; I; HP-UX A.09.05)"
</pre>
(except all one line). If you are using the Apache server, you can generate
this with the <kbd>mod_log_config</kbd> module, using the Apache command
<pre>
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""
</pre>
It is usually better to use the combined log than separate logs, because it
stores more information in less space.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="IISfmt">The Microsoft IIS logfile</a> looks like
<pre>
192.64.25.41, -, 25/12/98, 17:45:35, W3SVC1, HOST1, 192.16.225.10,
2178, 303, 1243, 200, 0, GET, /~sret1/, -,
</pre>
(except all on one line; and sometimes with four-digit years).
However, the format is extremely badly designed, in that the date follows local
conventions: in other words, in North America the above example would have the
date <kbd>12/25/98</kbd> instead. Analog will diagnose which form the logfile
is in if possible: but if both the date and the month are at most 12, there
is no way to tell which format it is. In this case, it will advise you to use
the command
<kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT-NA</kbd> for North American date
format, or <kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT-INT</kbd> for international date format.
In some countries, the date will not be in either of these formats, in which
case you need to write your own <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command, based on the
examples in the <a href="logfmt.html#msnafmtex">next section</a>.
<p>
There are also various third-party extensions to the Microsoft format to
include, for example, the browser and referrer. But they all do it in
different ways, so analog can't automatically diagnose them, and again, you
need to write a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command for them.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="websitefmt">The WebSite format</a> looks like
<pre>
12/25/98 17:45:35  jay.bird.com  host1  Server  fred  GET  /~sret1/
http://www.site.com/    Mozilla/2.0 (X11; I; HP-UX A.09.05)  200  1243  2178
</pre>
(except all on one line, and with the fields separated by tabs). It suffers
from the same problem with ambiguous dates as the IIS logfile (above), so
again you might have to use <kbd>LOGFORMAT WEBSITE-NA</kbd> or <kbd>LOGFORMAT
WEBSITE-INT</kbd>, or even have to write your own <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="machttpfmt">The MacHTTP format</a> looks like
<pre>
12/25/98  17:45:35   OK    jay.bird.com  /~sret1/  1243
</pre>
with the fields separated by tabs.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="restfmts">The W3 extended log</a>, the Netscape log, and the WebSTAR
log can be recognised
because they <b>must</b> include at or near the top a line telling analog
what format to expect on subsequent lines. (They may also contain later lines
changing the format). If the header line is missing, analog won't be able to
interpret the subsequent lines and so won't be able to analyse the logfile. In
this case, you will have to either replace the missing header or use a
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command to tell analog your format.
<p>
<a name="dateonly">If analog</a> finds that the header line is corrupt, it
will usually tell you what was wrong with it.
The most common problem is that
you're not allowed the time without the date or vice
versa -- in particular, having the date just at the top of the logfile is not
sufficient; you must have it on each line. By default, Microsoft servers
produce extended
logs with the date only at the top. But if the date changes during the
logfile, the server doesn't then write a new date line. This means that
missing days or corrupt entries can make analog get a day out in either
direction, with no way to rescue or even recognise the situation!
<p>
For this reason analog knows that it
can't analyse such logfiles safely, so instead it insists that the date should
be on every line. There are some programs on the
<a href="helpers.html">helper applications page</a> to put the date on each 
line. If you already have such a logfile you might want to use one of these
programs, but they have to assume that the date doesn't change during the
logfile, so it would be much safer to tell your server to log the date on every
line in future.
<p>
<a name="extendedfmt">The extended log</a> is described at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html</a>.
Its header line looks like
<pre>
#Fields: date time cs-uri
</pre>
In the rest of the logfile, the fields can be separated by spaces or tabs.
Remember the logfile <b>must</b> contain the date as well as the time on every
line -- see <a href="#dateonly">above</a>.
<p>
There is also Microsoft's attempt at the extended format -- unfortunately they
didn't read the spec., so they didn't enclose the browser and referrer in
quotes, they replaced spaces in the browser name with <kbd>+</kbd>'s, and they
put the time taken to serve the request in milliseconds instead of seconds.
And there is WebSTAR's attempt which is very nearly right except that they
erroneously used the <kbd>CS-HOST</kbd> field as the client hostname instead
of the server hostname. Analog will understand all of these versions.
<p>
Extended logs always record the time in GMT, so you will probably need to use a
<kbd><a href="output.html#TIMEOFFSET">LOGTIMEOFFSET</a></kbd> command to
convert to your local timezone.
<p>
<a name="webstarfmt">The WebSTAR format</a> is described at <a href="http://www.starnine.com/webstar/docs/ws4manual.3f.html">http://www.starnine.com/webstar/docs/ws4manual.3f.html</a>.
It has a header line like
<pre>
!!LOG_FORMAT DATE TIME RESULT URL BYTES_SENT HOSTNAME
</pre>
In the rest of the logfile, the fields are separated by tabs. The WebSTAR
server also records the time in GMT, so again you will probably need to use a
<kbd><a href="output.html#TIMEOFFSET">LOGTIMEOFFSET</a></kbd> command to
convert to your local timezone. Some other Mac servers also use the WebSTAR
format, or something looking like it. Analog will understand these too.
<p>
<a name="netscapefmt">Finally, the Netscape</a> header line looks like
<pre>
format=%Ses->client.ip% [%SYSDATE%] "%Req->reqpb.clf-request%"
%Req->srvhdrs.clf-status% %Req->srvhdrs.content-length%
</pre>

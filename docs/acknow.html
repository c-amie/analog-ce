<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0: Acknowledgements</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

Many people have helped me with analog, and I can't thank them all
specifically. But I do appreciate everyone who's given me feedback or sent me
bug reports.

<p>
Thanks are due to the author of getstats,
Kevin Hughes. In the days before analog there were only three serious logfile
analysis programs, and only one of them, getstats, had attractive output. I
wrote analog when getstats stopped being able to cope with the size of our
logfile, but my output was based on his, and still shows its parentage.

<p>
Thanks are also due to all those who helped in the early stages of writing
this program, and gave me the encouragement to continue with analog and to
release it publicly. Those who made helpful suggestions during the first few
weeks of the program are
numerous, but I must mention particularly Dan Anderson, Martyn Johnson,
Joe Ramey, Chris Ritson, Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Dave Stanworth. Above
all Gareth McCaughan gave me lots of programming advice. The early versions of
the program would have run much more slowly without him.

<p>
My employer, <a href="http://www.clicktracks.com/">ClickTracks</a>, kindly let
me continue to develop analog while I am working for them. More than that --
they even let me incorporate some code developed for ClickTracks into analog!

<p>
For six years, analog's home page was at my previous employer, the
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge Statistical
Laboratory</a>. Now it is provided by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.
<a href="http://www.niccx.com/">niccx.com</a> donated the address
<tt>analog.cx</tt>, and Takayuki Matsuki of Tokyo Kasei University and
Peter Gradwell of gradwell dot com ltd provide DNS services.
<p>
<a href="http://www.meer.net/">meer.net</a> very kindly provide the mailing
lists for analog, as well as a mailbox for the analog-author mail. Thank you
too to Aengus for administering the mailing lists,
<a href="http://www.gmane.org/">GMane</a> for turning them into newsgroups,
and <a href="mailing.html#listarchives">all the services</a> who provide list
archives.
<p>
Thanks to Ian Jackson for providing official FTP and rsync sites for analog,
and for hosting the old versions of the documentation.
Many other people have provided mirror sites for analog, starting with
Dave Stanworth (again!). The full list of mirror sites is listed <a
href="http://www.analog.cx/mirrors.html">elsewhere</a>; thanks to all of them.

<p>
Mark Roedel first suggested porting analog to different platforms, and made
the original DOS port. Shortly afterwards, Jason Linhart made the Mac port,
and has continued to contribute lots of extra code for that platform and for
the program in general. The Mac version also includes code contributed by
Stephan Somogyi and Nigel Perry. Later ports were made by Dave Jones, Martin
Zinser &amp; Rick Dyson (OpenVMS), Magnus Hagander (Win32),
Ivan Martinez (OS/2), Nick Smith &amp; Stefan Bellon (RISC OS),
Scott Tadman &amp; Rob Judd (BeOS),
Thomas Engel (NeXTSTEP), Martin Kraemer &amp; Holger Schranz (BS2000/OSD,
including EBCDIC support), and Hideyuki Yahagi (AS/400).
Thank you also to the people who make precompiled versions available for
various platforms.

The regular expression parsing is taken from Philip Hazel's
<a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE library</a>. The graphics use
Thomas Boutell's <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">gd</a> library,
the <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng library</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.zlib.org/">zlib library</a> by
Jean-loup Gailly &amp; Mark Adler. Logfile decompression uses the
<a href="http://www.zlib.org/">zlib library</a>, Gilles Vollant's
<a href="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html">unzip library</a> and
Julian Seward's <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">bzip2 library</a>.

<p>
The XML output style was written by Per Jessen.
The form interface is based on an idea by James Dean Palmer. The code to
expand wildcards in directory names under Unix is by Owen Cliffe. Thanks to
all the other people who have contributed bits of code too: I apologise for
not having room to name all of them.
<p>
Thanks also to those who have written
<a href="helpers.html">helper applications</a>, for making analog more usable,
and to those who have written <a href="../how-to/index.html">How-To's</a>, for
sharing their experience of how to use analog in practical situations. And
thanks to Alexander Toth for the Unix man page.
<p>

<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0:
Starting to use analog under Windows</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

This describes how to set up analog under Windows 95/NT or later.
Windows 3.1 users will have to read the section on
<a href="startux.html">other platforms</a> instead.

<p>
Here is the really short summary:
<ol>
  <li>Edit <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>
  <li>Run analog (a DOS window flashes up).
  <li>Read <kbd>Report.html</kbd>
</ol>

<p>
There's also a <a href="../how-to/startwin/index.html">How-To</a> written by
Simon Handfield, which explains how to get started in more detail with lots of
pictures.

<hr size=1 noshade>
When you've downloaded analog, and either you or your browser has unzipped
it, you will find in the analog folder a configuration file called
<kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> and the analog executable itself, as well as the Readme,
the <a href="Licence.txt">Licence</a> and a couple of other files.
There is no <kbd>setup.exe</kbd>: analog is already ready to run without one.

<p>
(Some unzip programs are broken, and do not create folders when they should. If
you don't have a folder called <kbd>lang</kbd> inside the analog folder,
create one and put all the files called <kbd>*.lng</kbd> and <kbd>*.tab</kbd>
into it.)

<p>
There are two ways of running analog. You can either run it from Windows
(by single-clicking or double-clicking on its icon, depending on your setup),
or you can run it from the DOS command prompt (under Start-Programs). If you
run it from Windows, it will create a DOS window to run in. When it's
finished, it will produce an output file called <kbd>Report.html</kbd> and
some graphics; and a file called <kbd>errors.txt</kbd> which contains any
errors there might have been. <b>The first time you run it, this will all
happen almost instantly. This is not a bug.</b> For help in
interpreting the output, see <cite><a href="meaning.html">What the results
mean</a></cite>.

<hr size=1 noshade>
You can configure analog by putting commands in the configuration file,
<kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>. Although this is less familiar to Windows users than
pressing buttons etc., it's really much simpler and more flexible when you get
used to it. You can edit <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> using any plain text editor, for
example Notepad. One command you will need straight away is
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename    # to set where your logfile lives
</pre>
The logfile must be stored locally -- analog won't use FTP or HTTP to fetch
it from the internet. There's a sample logfile supplied with the program.

<p>
There are already some configuration commands to get you started in the
configuration file, but there are lots of others available. You can find the
most common ones in the section on <a href="basiccmd.html">basic commands</a>
later in the Readme, and you can read about all of them in
the section on <a href="custom.html">customising analog</a>.
There are also some sample configuration files in the examples folder.

<p>
If you run analog from the DOS command prompt, there is another way to give
options, via
command line arguments, given on the command line after the program name.
These are just shortcuts for configuration file commands. You can use the
command line arguments if you run analog from a batch file too.

<p>
If you want to compile your own version of analog (it's written in C), or
just to read the source code, it's available from the
<a href="https://www.c-amie.co.uk/software/analog/">analog home page</a>.
(It's the same source code for all versions).

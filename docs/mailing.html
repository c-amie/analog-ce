<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog 6.0: Mailing lists</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

I welcome mail about analog, both praise and bug reports! I and others are
also usually happy to help people who have trouble with analog: it helps me
to find bugs, and know where the documentation is unclear.
<p>
If your statistics are provided by someone else, for example your web hosting
company, you should normally get support from them. They're the only ones who
can configure analog to your specifications.
<p>
There are three mailing lists for analog.
<dl>
<dt><kbd>analog-announce</kbd>
<dd>Announcements about analog. I post to this when there are new versions,
for example. Only gets a few messages a year. You can join this list by
filling in the form at <a href="http://lists.meer.net/mailman/listinfo/analog-announce">http://lists.meer.net/mailman/listinfo/analog-announce</a>
<dt><kbd>analog-help</kbd>
<dd>Getting help with analog from experienced users. This is the place to go
if you have trouble setting up or configuring the program. Usually you will
get a swift reply. <em>You have to subscribe to the list before you can send a
message. This is necessary to deter spammers.</em> You can subscribe at <a href="http://lists.meer.net/mailman/listinfo/analog-help">http://lists.meer.net/mailman/listinfo/analog-help</a>
<dd>You can also read this list <a
href="http://news.gmane.org/thread.php?group=gmane.comp.web.analog.general">as
a forum</a> (but not post) or <a href="#listarchives">as a newsgroup</a>.
<dt><kbd>analog-author</kbd>
<dd>This just goes to me. Use for private comments, or other things that would
not be suitable for the <kbd>analog-help</kbd> list. I'm pretty bad at
answering my mail, so don't expect a swift reply. <em>Don't use this address
for user support questions: they will be ignored.</em>
</dl>

There is also an independent
<a href="http://jp.analog.cx/ml.html">Japanese analog mailing list</a>. And
there are also companies offering support for analog on a commercial basis:
you can find a list of them on the <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">analog home
page</a>.

<hr size=1 noshade>
If you want to get <em>help with analog</em>, please check the following
simple things first. (For articles on how to ask in such a way that you'll get
a useful answer, I recommend
Eric Raymond's <cite><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a></cite>
and Simon Tatham's <cite><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>.)
</cite>

<ol>
  <li>Read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>. Maybe I've answered your question
      already. If I have, I'll just direct you to the FAQ, not answer it
      again.
  <li>If analog produced some error messages when it ran, they probably
      indicate what went wrong. Read the section on
      <cite><a href="errors.html">Errors and warnings</a></cite>.
  <li>If your question is &quot;Will this command have that effect?&quot;, why
      not try it and see!
  <li>If you think you've found a bug, read the
      <a href="http://www.analog.cx/bugs.html">list of
      known bugs</a> at my site, to see if your bug is already known about.
  <li>Read the other relevant pages of the Readme, particularly the sections
      on <cite><a href="start.html">Starting to use analog</a></cite> and
      <cite><a href="custom.html">Customising analog</a></cite>. You may also
      find the <a href="indx.html">index</a> useful. We don't appreciate people
      who are too lazy to read the documentation. (If the documentation is
      unclear, or the relevant paragraph is too well hidden, then that's a
      different matter. Of course I want to know about that.)
  <li>Have a look in the <a href="#listarchives">web archives</a> of the
      mailing list to see if your question has already been answered there.
  <li>If analog isn't doing what you thought you asked it to, then run it with
      the <kbd><a href="syntax.html#settings">SETTINGS ON</a></kbd>
      configuration
      command, and see what options it thinks it's meant to be using.
</ol>
I'm sorry to be so fussy, but a lot of the mail on the list really needn't
have been sent at all, and just wastes the time of everybody on the list. As
I say, I really do welcome genuine mail.
<p>
If you still need help, subscribe to the to the analog-help mailing list using
the form at
<a href="http://lists.meer.net/mailman/listinfo/analog-help">http://lists.meer.net/mailman/listinfo/analog-help</a>,
and then send your mail to analog-help@lists.meer.net.
Please do the following when you send mail to the list.
<ol>
  <li>Describe exactly what you did, what you expected, and what the computer
      did. Include the <em>exact text</em> of any error messages, not a
      pr&eacute;cis.
  <li>Mention which version of analog you are using, on which operating
      system.
  <li>Although you should obey the first two points, you should also try and
      send a short message. Most people don't bother to read long messages.
  <li>Give your mail a subject line which indicates immediately what aspect of
      analog it is about. (This is useful for the archives).
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> send long files or attachments unless you're
      asked to. We do not want to see your configuration file, your header
      file, your output file, or any logfile over 10 lines long. They are
      almost always useless to us. And anyway, excessively long messages will
      be rejected by the mailing list server.

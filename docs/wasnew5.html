      masks</a>.

      command to list kilobytes etc. to a chosen number of decimal places. The
      default number of decimal places has changed from three to two.

      (Thanks to Stefan Bellon for this code).
  <dd>Various bug fixes.
  <dd>Indonesian and Slovak language files.

      attack</a>.
  <dd>Also <a href="form.html#security">emphasised</a> in the documentation

  <dd>All the <a href="timereps.html#BARSTYLE"><kbd>BARSTYLE</kbd>s</a>

  <dd>Ignores completely blank lines at the top of a logfile.
  <dd>Makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ can be found in the new
      <kbd>src/build</kbd> directory. Makefiles for other platforms have moved
      out of the source tree into there too.
  <dd>You can now refer to kilobytes as kibibytes by

  <dd>The person setting up the form interface can now
      <a href="form.html#security">specify a list of allowed commands</a>,
      rather than a list of forbidden commands.
  <dd>The <a href="output.html#outstyle"><kbd>LATEX</kbd> output style</a> now
      works with the ISO-Latin-2 character set as well as ISO-Latin-1. New
      command <a href="output.html#outstyle"><kbd>PDFLATEX</kbd></a>.
  <dd>New <a href="logfmt.html#fmtstrings"><kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> token</a>

	them.
    <li>New command
	<kbd><a href="output.html#GENSUMLINES">GENSUMLINES</a></kbd> to control
	which lines are listed in the General Summary.
    <li>The &quot;Distinct hosts&quot; line now appears in the General
	Summary even if you aren't making a Host, Organisation or Domain
	Report.
    <li>New commands
	<a href="output.html#DESCRIPTIONS"><kbd>DESCRIPTIONS</kbd> and
	<kbd>DESCFILE</kbd></a> to provide descriptions of each report.

	<kbd>ROBOTEXCLUDE</kbd></a> for listing robots in the Operating System
	Report.

	allow the internal search reports.
    <li>New command <kbd><a href="dns.html#DNSTIMEOUT">DNSTIMEOUT</a></kbd>
	(on some platforms) to reduce the time taken for failed DNS lookups.
    <li>New <a href="include.html#LINKINCLUDE"><kbd>LINKINCLUDE</kbd> and
	<kbd>LINKEXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands. (See
	<a href="update.html#up415">how to upgrade</a>).
    <li><a href="othreps.html#othCOLS">New columns</a> <kbd>E</kbd> and
	<kbd>e</kbd> for time of first request; and <kbd>S</kbd>,

	busiest time period for the time reports.

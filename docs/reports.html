<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog 6.0: Analog's reports</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

This section summarises all of analog's reports, and the main commands which
control them. For details on these commands, see the sections on
<cite><a href="timereps.html">Time reports</a></cite>,
<cite><a href="othreps.html">Other reports</a></cite> and
<cite><a href="hierreps.html">Hierarchical reports</a></cite>.
For exact details on what is counted in each report, see the section on
<cite><a href="defns.html">Analog's definitions</a></cite>.
<p>
You can get descriptions of each report within the output by using the
<a href="output.html#DESCRIPTIONS"><kbd>DESCRIPTIONS</kbd> and
<kbd>DESCFILE</kbd></a> commands.
<p>
Note: The examples below are in the HTML output style. Most people are using
the XHTML output style, but I've used the HTML output style for the
documentation to make sure that it works on all browsers.

<h3><a name="reptop">Top lines</a></h3>

<hr size=1 noshade>
Program started at Thu-24-Sep-1998 13:48.
<br>Analysed requests from Wed-16-Sep-1998 09:52 to Mon-21-Sep-1998
  02:04 (4.7 days).
<hr size=1 noshade>

The top two lines of the output tell you when the program was run, and
which dates it includes data from. (The second line includes all non-excluded
requests, even failures, whereas most reports only include successful
requests.)

<h3><a name="repgen">General Summary</a></h3>

<hr size=1 noshade>
(Figures in parentheses refer to the 7 days to 24-Sep-1998 13:48).
<br><b>Successful requests:</b> 79,646 (48,947)
<br><b>Average successful requests per day:</b> 17,036 (6,992)
<br><b>Successful requests for pages:</b> 31,138 (18,689)
<br><b>Average successful requests for pages per day:</b> 6,660 (2,669)
<br><b>Failed requests:</b> 9,008 (6,378)
<br><b>Redirected requests:</b> 344 (235)
<br><b>Distinct files requested:</b> 8,180 (2,884)
<br><b>Distinct hosts served:</b> 6,640 (4,991)
<br><b>Corrupt logfile lines:</b> 2
<br><b>Data transferred:</b> 976.92 Mbytes (627.06 Mbytes)
<br><b>Average data transferred per day:</b> 208.96 Mbytes (89.58 Mbytes)
<hr size=1 noshade>

The General Summary contains some overall statistics about the data being
analysed: the most important being the number of <b>requests</b> (the total
number of files downloaded, including graphics); the number of <b>requests for
pages</b> (just counting the various pages on your site); the number of
<b>distinct hosts</b> (the number of different computers requests have come
from); and the amount of <b>data transferred</b> in bytes. For exactly what
the various lines mean, see the section on <cite><a href="defns.html">Analog's
definitions</a></cite>. Bear in mind that one user can generate many requests
by viewing lots of different pages or images, or by viewing the same page many
times.
<p>
The figures in parentheses represent the seven days given at the top of this
report: it's the seven days before the <kbd>TO</kbd> time if there was a
<kbd>TO</kbd> command, or if not the seven days before the program was run.
<p>
You can't find out the number of visitors or visits you've had, and don't
believe any program which tells you that you can. See the section on
<cite><a href="webworks.html">How the web works</a></cite> for a discussion of
this.
<p>
You can turn this report on or off with the
<kbd><a href="output.html#replist">GENERAL</a></kbd> command.
You can control which lines are included using the
<kbd><a href="output.html#GENSUMLINES">GENSUMLINES</a></kbd> command.
You can include
or exclude the figures for the last seven days with the
<kbd><a href="output.html#LASTSEVEN">LASTSEVEN</a></kbd> command.
You may get slightly different lines to those above, depending on exactly
what's in your logfile.

<h3><a name="reptime">Time reports</a></h3>

<hr size=1 noshade>
Each unit (<img src="barb1.gif" alt="+">) represents 800 requests for pages, or part thereof.
<pre><tt>week beg.: #reqs: pages: 
---------: -----: -----: 
13/Sep/98: 69614: 25277: <img src="barb32.gif" alt="++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++">
20/Sep/98: 10032:  5861: <img src="barb8.gif" alt="++++++++">
</tt></pre>
Busiest week: week beginning 13/Sep/98 (26,654 requests for pages).
<hr size=1 noshade>

These reports tell you how many requests there were in each time
period. They also tell you which was the busiest time period.
<p>
The timezone is whatever your server records time in -- usually your server's
local time, or sometimes GMT. You can adjust it to another timezone with the
<kbd><a href="output.html#TIMEOFFSET">LOGTIMEOFFSET</a></kbd> command.

<p>You can control whether each report is included or not with the appropriate
<a href="output.html#replist"><kbd>ON</kbd> or <kbd>OFF</kbd></a> command.
You can control which columns are listed by the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#timeCOLS">COLS</a></kbd> commands. You can control
which measurement to use for the bar charts and the &quot;busiest&quot; line
by the <kbd><a href="timereps.html#GRAPH">GRAPH</a></kbd> commands. You can
determine how many rows are displayed with the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#ROWS">ROWS</a></kbd> commands. You can display the
lines backwards or forwards in time by the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#BACK">BACK</a></kbd> commands. You can change the
graphic used for the bar charts with the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#BARSTYLE">BARSTYLE</a></kbd> command.

<h3><a name="reptimesum">Time summaries</a></h3>

<hr size=1 noshade>
Each unit (<img src="barb1.gif" alt="+">) represents 150 requests for pages, or part thereof.
<pre><tt>day: #reqs: pages: 
---: -----: -----: 
Sun:  2031:  1193: <img src="barb8.gif" alt="++++++++">
Mon:  8001:  4668: <img src="barb32.gif" alt="++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++">
Tue:     0:     0: 
Wed: 13934:  5915: <img src="barb32.gif" alt="++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"><img src="barb8.gif" alt="">
[etc.]
</tt></pre>
<hr size=1 noshade>

These reports tell you the total number of requests in each day or hour of the
week, or in each period of the day, summed over all the weeks or days in the
report. (It's not the average, nor is it the figures for just the last week or
last day).

<p>You can control whether each report is included or not with the appropriate
<a href="output.html#replist"><kbd>ON</kbd> or <kbd>OFF</kbd></a> command.
You can control which columns are listed by the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#timeCOLS">COLS</a></kbd> commands. You can control
which measurement to use for the bar charts by the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#GRAPH">GRAPH</a></kbd> commands. You can change the
graphic used for the bar charts with the
<kbd><a href="timereps.html#BARSTYLE">BARSTYLE</a></kbd> command.


<h3><a name="repoth">Other reports</a></h3>

The rest of the reports are all quite similar. Here is a list of them. If
you're unfamiliar with some of the terms, see the section on
<cite><a href="defns.html">Analog's definitions</a></cite>.
<ul>
<li>The Host Report lists all <b>computers</b> which downloaded files from you.
<li>The Domain Report lists which <b>countries</b> those computers came
    from. (If you only get &quot;unresolved numerical addresses&quot;, see the
    <a href="faq.html#faq140">FAQ</a>.)
<li>The Organisation Report <a href="domfile.html#orgrules">attempts</a> to
    list the <b>organisations</b> (companies, institutions, ISPs etc.) which
    the computer was registered under.
<li>The Host Redirection Report and Host Failure Report list all computers
    which encountered redirections or errors.
<li>The Request Report (the example above) lists which <b>files</b> were
    downloaded.
<li>The Directory Report lists which <b>directories</b> those files came from.
<li>The File Type Report lists the <b>file types</b> (actually, extensions) of
    those files.
<li>The File Size Report breaks them down by <b>size</b>.
<li>The Processing Time Report shows the <b>time taken</b> to serve each file.
<li>The Redirection Report lists the filenames which resulted in redirections:
    mainly directories without the final slash, and
    &quot;<b>click-thru</b>&quot;'s.
<li>The Failure Report lists the filenames which caused errors.
<li>The Referrer Report lists which pages <b>linked</b> to your files (and
    also pages which included your images).
<li>The Referring Site Report lists the servers those referrers were on.
<li>The Search Query Report and the Search Word Report list which <b>search
    terms</b> people used to find your site (provided you've used the
    appropriate <kbd><a href="args.html#SEARCHENGINE">SEARCHENGINE</a></kbd>
    commands).
<li>The Internal Search Query Report and Internal Search Word Report list the
    search terms people used on scripts within your site (provided
    you've used the appropriate
    <kbd><a href="args.html#SEARCHENGINE">INTSEARCHENGINE</a></kbd> commands).
<li>The Redirected Referrer Report lists the referrers which led to
    redirections.
<li>The Failed Referrer Report is essentially a <b>broken link</b> report.
<li>The Browser Report lists the detailed versions of <b>browsers</b> used,
    and the Browser Summary collects them by vendor. You should be aware that
    browsers can lie about what sort of browser they are.
<li>The Operating System Report lists the <b>operating systems</b> of the
    visitors whose browser types you know (as far as possible: it's not always
    possible to distinguish accurately between different Windows versions, for
    example, because the same browser can run on more than one Windows
    version).
    Which browsers count as robots is controlled by the
    <a href="include.html#ROBOTINCLUDE"><kbd>ROBOTINCLUDE</kbd> and
      <kbd>ROBOTEXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands.
<li>The Virtual Host Report lists the activity of your various <b>virtual
    domains</b>.
<li>The Virtual Host Redirection Report and Virtual Host Failure Report give
    the number of redirections and errors on each of those domains.
<li>The User Report lists your <b>visitors</b> if your server requires
    authentication; or perhaps the visitors' cookies or session ids.
<li>The User Redirection Report and User Failure Report list the users who
    encountered redirections or errors.
<li>The Status Code Report lists the number of each
    <b>HTTP status code</b> that you had.
</ul>
Usually you can only get some of these reports, depending on what information
is recorded in your logfile.

<p>There are lots of commands which control these reports.
As usual, you can control whether each report is included or not with the
appropriate <a href="output.html#replist"><kbd>ON</kbd> or <kbd>OFF</kbd></a>
command.
You can control which columns are listed with the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#othCOLS">COLS</a></kbd> commands.
You can change how the reports are sorted with the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#SORTBY">SORTBY</a></kbd> commands.
You can control how many items are listed with the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#FLOOR">FLOOR</a></kbd> commands.
You can control whether and how the pie charts are plotted with the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#CHART">CHART</a></kbd> commands.
You can list the time period covered by each report with the
<a href="othreps.html#REPORTSPAN"><kbd>REPORTSPAN</kbd></a> command.
You can include or
exclude individual items with the <a href="include.html#outputexcludes">output
<kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands.
You can change the names of items in the reports with the
<a href="alias.html#OUTPUTALIAS">output alias</a> commands.
Which files are linked to in the reports is controlled by the
<a href="include.html#LINKINCLUDE"><kbd>LINKINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>LINKEXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands. The links are also affected by the
<kbd><a href="othreps.html#BASEURL">BASEURL</a></kbd> command.

<p>The &quot;not listed&quot; line at the bottom counts those items which
didn't get enough traffic to get above the <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> for the report.
(It doesn't include items which you've explicitly
<a href="include.html">excluded</a>.)

<p>Most of these reports have a hierarchical structure, like this example for
the Domain Report:
<hr size=1 noshade>
Listing the first 5 domains by the number of requests, sorted by 
  the number of requests.
<pre><tt>no.: #reqs: %bytes: domain
---: -----: ------: ------
  1: 13243: 16.23%: .com (Commercial)
   :  1262:  1.26%:   aol.com
  2: 11783: 25.64%: .jp (Japan)
   :  9592: 22.19%:   ad.jp
   :  1043:  1.97%:   co.jp
  3: 10073: 11.62%: .net (Network)
   :  1926:  1.71%:   uu.net
  4:  9657: 13.31%: [unresolved numerical addresses]
  5:  7388:  8.04%: .uk (United Kingdom)
   :  5792:  5.74%:   ac.uk
   :  1510:  1.99%:   co.uk
   : 18502: 25.16%: [not listed: 82 domains]
</tt></pre>
<hr size=1 noshade>
Notice that the lower levels are always listed with their parents, so they
break up the sort order. Also, they don't count towards the total number of
items listed, so there are only 5 domains listed in the example above, as you
can see in the first column. (The <a href="othreps.html#othCOLS"><kbd>N</kbd>
column</a> is particularly useful in hierarchical reports for this reason.)
<p>
You can control which items are listed on the lower levels by the
<a href="hierreps.html"><kbd>SUB</kbd></a> family of commands.
There are also separate
<a href="hierreps.html#SUBSORTBY">sub-<kbd>SORTBY</kbd></a> and
<a href="hierreps.html#SUBFLOOR">sub-<kbd>FLOOR</kbd></a> commands for the
lower levels. (These commands are called
<a href="hierreps.html#ARGSSORTBY"><kbd>ARGSSORTBY</kbd></a> and
<a href="hierreps.html#ARGSFLOOR"><kbd>ARGSFLOOR</kbd></a> for some reports,
such as the Request Report.) You can plot the lower levels instead of the
top-level items on the pie charts using the 
<kbd><a href="hierreps.html#CHARTEXPAND">CHARTEXPAND</a></kbd> commands.

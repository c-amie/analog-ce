<hr size=2 noshade>

This section deals with the non-time reports. There are quite a lot of
commands which control these reports, although we've seen some of them
already.

<p>
<a name="othCOLS">First</a>, these reports have <kbd>COLS</kbd> commands, just
like the time
reports. (See the section on <cite><a href="timereps.html#timeCOLS">Time
reports</a></cite> for how to use these commands.) But for these reports,
several additional columns are available. Here is the full list of columns for
the non-time reports
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>R</kbd><dd>Number of requests
  <dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Percentage of the requests
  <dt><kbd>S</kbd><dd>Number of requests in the last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Percentage of the requests in the last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>P</kbd><dd>Number of page requests
  <dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Percentage of the page requests
  <dt><kbd>Q</kbd><dd>Number of page requests in the last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Percentage of the page requests in the last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>B</kbd><dd>Number of bytes transferred
  <dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>Percentage of the bytes
  <dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd>Number of bytes transferred in the last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>c</kbd><dd>Percentage of the bytes in the last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Date of last access
  <dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Date and time of last access
  <dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd>Date of first access
  <dt><kbd>E</kbd><dd>Date and time of first access
  <dt><kbd>N</kbd><dd>The number of the item in the list
</dl>
So, for example,
<pre>
REQCOLS NRSD
</pre>
counts the files in the Request Report, listing the number of requests for
each, the number of requests for each in the last 7 days, and the time when
each was last requested. The full list of
<kbd>COLS</kbd>
commands for non-time reports is <kbd>HOSTCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRHOSTCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILHOSTCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>ORGCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>DOMCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>REQCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>DIRCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>TYPECOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>SIZECOLS</kbd>, <kbd>PROCTIMECOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>REFCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REFSITECOLS</kbd>, <kbd>SEARCHQUERYCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>SEARCHWORDCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>INTSEARCHQUERYCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>INTSEARCHWORDCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>BROWREPCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSUMCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>OSCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>VHOSTCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRVHOSTCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILVHOSTCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>USERCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRUSERCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILUSERCOLS</kbd> and <kbd>STATUSCOLS</kbd>. Not
every column is allowed in every report, but if you specify an illegal one,
analog will warn you about it.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="SORTBY">Next</a> you need to know how use a <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> command
to specify
how the reports should be sorted. There are ten possible ways of sorting
reports:
<dl>
  <dt><kbd>REQUESTS</kbd><dd>total number of requests</dd>
  <dt><kbd>REQUESTS7</kbd><dd>requests within the last 7 days</dd>
  <dt><kbd>PAGES</kbd><dd>total requests for pages</dd>
  <dt><kbd>PAGES7</kbd><dd>requests for pages within the last 7 days</dd>
  <dt><kbd>BYTES</kbd><dd>total bytes transferred</dd>
  <dt><kbd>BYTES7</kbd><dd>bytes transferred within the last 7 days</dd>
  <dt><kbd>FIRSTDATE</kbd><dd>time of first request</dd>
  <dt><kbd>DATE</kbd><dd>time of most recent request</dd>
  <dt><kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd><dd>alphabetically</dd>
  <dt><kbd>RANDOM</kbd><dd>unsorted, sometimes useful
      for speed in very long reports</dd>
</dl>

For example, the command
<pre>
HOSTSORTBY ALPHABETICAL
</pre>
will sort the Host Report alphabetically. The full list of <kbd>SORTBY</kbd>
commands is <kbd>HOSTSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRHOSTSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILHOSTSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>ORGSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>DOMSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>REQSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>DIRSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>TYPESORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>REDIRSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>FAILSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REFSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>REFSITESORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>SEARCHQUERYSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>SEARCHWORDSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>INTSEARCHQUERYSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>INTSEARCHWORDSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>BROWREPSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSUMSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>OSSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>VHOSTSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRVHOSTSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILVHOSTSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>USERSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRUSERSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILUSERSORTBY</kbd> and <kbd>STATUSSORTBY</kbd>.
Again, not every sort method is possible in every
report, but you'll be warned if you choose an illegal one.
<p>
There is one known bug concerned with <kbd>SORTBY ALPHABETICAL</kbd>. The
report is sorted before any
<a href="alias.html#OUTPUTALIAS">output alias</a> is
applied. This means that if an output alias has been specified for
the report, then the report may appear not to be sorted correctly.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="FLOOR">You can also</a> specify a <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> for most reports,
saying how much activity an item needs before it is listed on the report.
(Other items will just be accumulated together in the &quot;not listed&quot;
line at the bottom of the report.) There are lots
of possible ways of specifying floors, which I'll list here, using the
<kbd>DOMFLOOR</kbd> (Domain Report <kbd>FLOOR</kbd>) command as an example.
Essentially each one consists of a number indicating the level of the floor,
followed by a letter indicating the floor criterion.
<pre>
DOMFLOOR 1000r       # all domains with at least 1000 requests
DOMFLOOR 100s        # at least 100 requests within the last 7 days
DOMFLOOR 1000p       # at least 1000 requests for pages
DOMFLOOR 100q        # at least 100 requests for pages within the last 7 days
DOMFLOOR 1000000b    # at least 1,000,000 bytes transferred
DOMFLOOR 1kb         # at least 1 kilobyte (1024 bytes)
DOMFLOOR 10.5Mc      # at least 10.5Mb within the last 7 days
DOMFLOOR 0.5%r       # 0.5% of the total requests in the Domain Report
                     # (ditto %s, %p etc.)
DOMFLOOR 0.5:r       # 0.5% of the maximum number of requests for any domain
                     # (ditto :s, :p etc.)
DOMFLOOR 970701d     # last access since 1st July 1997
DOMFLOOR 970701e     # first access since 1st July 1997
DOMFLOOR -00-01-00d  # last access in last month (see
                     # documentation on <a href="include.html#FROMTO">FROM and TO</a> commands)
DOMFLOOR -100r       # domains with top 100 number of requests
                     # (ditto -100s, p, q, b, c, d, or e)
</pre>
The full list of <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> commands is <kbd>HOSTFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>REDIRHOSTFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>FAILHOSTFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>DOMFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>ORGFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REQFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>DIRFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>TYPEFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>FAILFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>REFFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REFSITEFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>SEARCHQUERYFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>SEARCHWORDFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>INTSEARCHQUERYFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>INTSEARCHWORDFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>BROWREPFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSUMFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>OSFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>VHOSTFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRVHOSTFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILVHOSTFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>USERFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRUSERFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILUSERFLOOR</kbd> and <kbd>STATUSFLOOR</kbd>.
Once again, not every floor method is legal for
every report, but you'll be warned if you try and choose an illegal one.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="othclarg">I've already told you</a> about how to turn each report on
and off from the
command line using its <a href="output.html#replist">code letter</a>. In fact,
you can specify the <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> and the <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> in the same
command. Take the example of the Referrer Report. If you follow the
<kbd>+f</kbd> (to turn the report on) with a letter, it represents the
sort method according to the following code:
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd><kbd>REQUESTS</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd><kbd>REQUESTS7</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd><kbd>PAGES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd><kbd>PAGES7</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd><kbd>BYTES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>c</kbd><dd><kbd>BYTES7</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd><kbd>DATE</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd><kbd>FIRSTDATE</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd><kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd><kbd>RANDOM</kbd>
</dl>
You can then, or alternatively, use one of the above <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> formats
to specify the floor. If you specify a <kbd>SORTBY</kbd>, you can also leave
off the last letter of the floor, and analog will guess it according to the
sort method: the floor will be the same as the sort method, or by requests if
the sort method is <kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd> or <kbd>RANDOM</kbd>. Here are four
examples:
<dl compact>
<dt><kbd>+fp</kbd><dd>means turn the Referrer Report on and sort it by page
    requests, but says nothing about the floor;
<dt><kbd>+f100s</kbd><dd>means list all referrers with at least 100 requests
    in the last 7 days, but says nothing about the sort method;
<dt><kbd>+fb10000</kbd><dd>means list all referrers with at least 10,000 bytes,
    sorted by bytes;
<dt><kbd>+fa-000101d</kbd><dd>means list all referrers with accesses this year,
    sorted alphabetically.
</dl>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="CHART">Each of these reports</a> can have a pie chart drawn at
the top of it. The charts can be turned on and off, or plotted by a different
criterion, using the <kbd>CHART</kbd> commands. For example,
<pre>
REQCHART OFF
</pre>
will stop you getting a pie chart on the Request Report, whereas
<pre>
REQCHART ON
</pre>
will turn it back on. You can also use the following arguments to plot the
chart by a specific variable.
<dl>
  <dt><kbd>REQUESTS</kbd><dd>total number of requests</dd>
  <dt><kbd>REQUESTS7</kbd><dd>requests within the last 7 days</dd>
  <dt><kbd>PAGES</kbd><dd>total requests for pages</dd>
  <dt><kbd>PAGES7</kbd><dd>requests for pages within the last 7 days</dd>
  <dt><kbd>BYTES</kbd><dd>total bytes transferred</dd>
  <dt><kbd>BYTES7</kbd><dd>bytes transferred within the last 7 days</dd>
</dl>
By default, the chart will be plotted by the
<kbd><a href="#SORTBY">SORTBY</a></kbd> if that's one of the above six
variables, or else by the <kbd><a href="#FLOOR">FLOOR</a></kbd> if that's one
of the six, or failing both of those by <kbd>REQUESTS</kbd>.
Usually you just want to stick to the default, and analog will warn you if you
could have used the <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> or <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> and requested
something different.
<p>
The full list of <kbd>CHART</kbd> commands is
<kbd>HOSTCHART</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRHOSTCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILHOSTCHART</kbd>, <kbd>ORGCHART</kbd>, <kbd>DOMCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>REQCHART</kbd>, <kbd>DIRCHART</kbd>, <kbd>TYPECHART</kbd>,
<kbd>REDIRCHART</kbd>, <kbd>FAILCHART</kbd>, <kbd>REFCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>REFSITECHART</kbd>, <kbd>SEARCHQUERYCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>SEARCHWORDCHART</kbd>, <kbd>INTSEARCHQUERYCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>INTSEARCHWORDCHART</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFCHART</kbd>, <kbd>BROWREPCHART</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSUMCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>OSCHART</kbd>, <kbd>VHOSTCHART</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRVHOSTCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILVHOSTCHART</kbd>, <kbd>USERCHART</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRUSERCHART</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILUSERCHART</kbd>, <kbd>STATUSCHART</kbd>, <kbd>SIZECHART</kbd> and
<kbd>PROCTIMECHART</kbd>. Again, not every chart method is available for every
report. You can also use
<pre>
ALLCHART ON
ALLCHART OFF
</pre>
to turn them all on or off simultaneously.
<p>
<a name="CHARTDIR">The pie charts</a> are normally written to the same
directory as the
<kbd><a href="output.html#OUTFILE">OUTFILE</a></kbd>. But you can specify a
different location using the <kbd>CHARTDIR</kbd> and <kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> 
commands. If the <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> is standard output, 
you must use these commands, or you will not get any pie charts. Also, if you
are writing two output files to the same directory, you must use these
commands, or one set of images will overwrite the other.
And you also need to use these commands if you are using the form interface,
but there are <a href="form.html#formcharts">additional issues</a> in that
case.
<p>
You have to use both of the commands before they have any effect.
The <kbd>CHARTDIR</kbd> is the location of the pie chart directory on your
server, similar to the <kbd><a href="output.html#IMAGEDIR">IMAGEDIR</a></kbd>;
it's used for putting in the &lt;img&gt; tag to include the image. The
<kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> is the location on your local disk; it's where the
image is written to. For example, you might have
<pre>
CHARTDIR /images/
LOCALCHARTDIR /usr/local/apache/htdocs/images/
</pre>
to put the pie charts in locations like
<kbd>/usr/local/apache/htdocs/images/dom.png</kbd> and link to them like
<kbd>&lt;img src="/images/dom.png"&gt;</kbd>. On Windows, you will need to put
the <kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> in quotes, to stop the backslash at the end of
the line being interpreted to mean that the command continues on the next
line. For example,
<pre>
LOCALCHARTDIR "\webimages\analog\"
</pre>
Actually, the <kbd>CHARTDIR</kbd> and <kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> are just
prefixes to the filename, so you can specify something like
<pre>
CHARTDIR /stats/rep1
LOCALCHARTDIR /usr/local/htdocs/stats/rep1
</pre>
to put the pie charts in locations like
<kbd>/usr/local/htdocs/stats/rep1dom.png</kbd> and link to them like
<kbd>&lt;img src="/stats/rep1dom.png"&gt;</kbd>. Also the names can contain
<a href="logfile.html#datecodes">date codes</a> in the same way as the
<kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> and <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd>.
<p>
If you compiled your own version of analog, and you used your version of libgd
instead of mine (see the Makefile for how to do this), then you can use the
command
<pre>
JPEGCHARTS ON
</pre>
to make the charts in JPEG format instead of PNG. (See the
<kbd><a href="output.html#PNGIMAGES">PNGIMAGES</a></kbd> command for how to
make the bar charts in the time reports into gif's instead of png's.)
<p>
Here are the exact rules for which wedges are plotted in the pie chart. Up to
ten wedges, plus &quot;Other&quot;, are drawn,
but wedges are only drawn if they are large enough. Also, wedges are only
drawn if the item is listed in the main table for the report. And the whole
chart will not be plotted if it would contain only one wedge.
<p>
If you want to plot more detail on the pie charts, for example Windows 98
&amp; Windows NT instead of just Windows on the Operating System Report chart,
see <a href="hierreps.html#CHARTEXPAND">the next section</a>.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<a name="REPORTSPAN">You can list</a> the time period covered by each report.
This is off by default because it uses a lot of memory to calculate it, but
if different reports cover different time periods (which can happen if your
log format has changed at some point), it's useful to turn it on with the
command
<pre>
REPORTSPAN ON
</pre>
There is also a command called <kbd>REPORTSPANTHRESHOLD</kbd> (which can be
abbreviated <kbd>RSTHRESH</kbd>). This says that each report span should only
be listed if it differs from the overall span of the whole report -- listed at
the top of the page -- by at least this many minutes at one end. For example,
<pre>
REPORTSPANTHRESHOLD 60
</pre>
will only list a report span if that report starts at least an hour after the
start of the logfile, or ends at least an hour before the end of the logfile.
You can set
<pre>
REPORTSPANTHRESHOLD 0
</pre>
to make sure that the report span is listed on all the reports.

<hr size=1 noshade>
We've already seen some other commands affecting what was listed in the
non-time reports. The <a href="include.html#outputexcludes">output
<kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands specified lines to omit
from each report, and the
<a href="alias.html#OUTPUTALIAS">output alias</a> commands specified
some aliasing to do on the names before they were listed. There were also
<a href="include.html#LINKINCLUDE"><kbd>LINKINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>LINKEXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands to control what was linked to in the
reports. You might want to have another look at these paragraphs.
<p>
<a name="BASEURL">There's one other command</a> which affects the links in the
Request Report, Redirection Report and Failure Report.
The command <kbd>BASEURL</kbd> prepends an additional string to the URLs
in the target of the link. For example, after the command
<pre>
BASEURL http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk
</pre>
<kbd>/~sret1/</kbd> will be linked to
<kbd>http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/</kbd>, not just to
<kbd>/~sret1/</kbd>. This is very useful if you want to display the
statistics on a different server from the server they refer to. If you want the
file to be listed as <kbd>http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/</kbd>, rather
than just to be linked to that address, you need to use the second argument to
the <kbd><a href="logfile.html#secondarg">LOGFILE</a></kbd> command instead.
<p>
In the next section, we'll look at commands for generating
<a href="hierreps.html">hierarchical reports</a>, which are closely related
to the commands in this section.

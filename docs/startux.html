<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0:
Starting to use analog on other platforms</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

Here is the really short summary:
<ol>
  <li>Edit <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd> and compile, if necessary
  <li>Edit <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>
  <li>Run analog
</ol>

<hr size=1 noshade>
Many platforms have a precompiled version of analog available. Before
compiling analog, have a look at the
<a href="https://www.c-amie.co.uk/software/analog/">analog home page</a> to see if yours does.
<p>
If you're not using one of the platforms for which a precompiled version
is available, you'll have to compile your own
version from the source. But don't worry -- it's written in
standard C throughout, so it will compile out of the box on most platforms.
(The source code is the same for all platforms.)

<p>
First, change to the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory.

<p>
Then look at the file anlghead.h, and see if there's anything you
want to edit.

<p>
When you have done that, you need to compile the program. How to do that
depends on which operating system you're using.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<b><a name="compileux">Compiling under Unix</a></b>. First edit anlghead.h as
described above. Then just type
<pre>
make
</pre>
within the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory
to compile the program. On most systems, that will be sufficient, and the
compiled program should appear in the parent directory. If it
fails to compile, have a look in the Makefile to see if there's anything that
you need to change to suit your configuration, and try again. It says in that
file what to do. In particular, <b>Solaris 2 (SunOS 5+)</b> users need to
change the <kbd>LIBS=</kbd> line.
<p>
(Experts can pass some arguments in on the <kbd>make</kbd> command line
instead of by editing <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd>: e.g.
<pre>
make DEFS='-DLANGDIR=\"/usr/etc/apache/analog/lang/\"'
</pre>
This is useful if you have a script to compile analog.)
<p>
If you haven't got gcc, you will need to change the compiler - try acc or cc
instead.
<p>
<b><a name="compileVMS">Compiling under OpenVMS</a></b>.
You can find OpenVMS build scripts within the
<kbd>src/build</kbd> directory.  Unzip them within the <kbd>src</kbd>
directory. Then to build Analog interactively from the command line, type
<pre>
$ @ Build_Analog
</pre>
or to submit the Build_Analog procedure to a batch queue, type
<pre>
$ Submit /NoPrint /Keep Batch.com
</pre>
The command procedure will use MMS (or MMK) if it is available, otherwise it
will compile everything from raw command procedures.
<p>
<b><a name="compileRiscOS">Compiling under Acorn RiscOS</a></b>. The Makefile
can be found in the <kbd>src/build</kbd> directly, although at this point it
has not been updated for version 5 of analog.
You will have to make directories called <kbd>C</kbd>,
<kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd>, and move the sources files into the appropriate
directories: e.g., <kbd>alias.c</kbd> must be renamed <kbd>C.alias</kbd>. And
you will find that there are some filenames in the header file
<kbd>anlghead.h</kbd> that you want to change to fit into the RiscOS directory
structure.
<p>
<b><a name="compileOS2">Compiling under OS/2</a></b>.
To compile analog for OS/2, you will need the
<a href="ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/emx/">EMX package</a>. You should
edit the Makefile to have <kbd>OS=OS2</kbd> and <kbd>LIBS=-lsocket</kbd>.
Then after editing anlghead.h and running Make, you need to run the command
<pre>
EMXBIND -b ANALOG
</pre>
to generate the analog.exe executable.
<hr size=1 noshade>
After you've compiled the program, leave the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory and
then just type
<pre>
analog
</pre>
to run the program. (Or <kbd>./analog</kbd> if for some reason <kbd>.</kbd>
isn't in your <kbd>$PATH</kbd>.)

<p>
You can configure analog by putting commands in the configuration file,
which is called <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> by default. Two commands you will need
straight away are
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename      # to set where your logfile lives
OUTFILE outputfile.html  # to send the output to a file instead of the screen
</pre>
The logfile must be stored locally -- analog won't use FTP or HTTP to fetch
it from the internet. There's a sample logfile supplied with the program.
For help in interpreting the output, see <cite><a href="meaning.html">What the
results mean</a></cite>.

<p>
There are already some configuration commands to get you started in the
configuration file, but there are lots of others available. You can find the
most common ones in the section on <a href="basiccmd.html">basic commands</a>
later in the Readme, and you can read about all of them in
the section on <a href="custom.html">customising analog</a>.
There are also some sample configuration files in the examples directory.
<p>
There is one other way to give options to analog, via command line arguments,
given on the command line after the program name. These are just shortcuts for
configuration file commands.

<h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog CE 6.0:
Upgrading from earlier versions</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

This section lists those commands which existed in older versions of analog,
but which have been changed or abolished in this version. It also lists reasons
why the same input might now produce different output. The new features in this
version are listed in the section <cite><a href="whatsnew.html">What's new in
this version?</a></cite>.
<p>
If you are upgrading from a previous version of analog, you should keep your
old <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>, and your old <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd> if you are
compiling your own copy of analog rather than using one of the precompiled
versions.

<h2><a name="up060004">Upgrading from 6.0.3 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug fixes in XML schema allow XML output under Analog 6.0  
  <li>If using XML <kbd><a href="output.html#outstyle">OUTPUT</a></kbd> a new XMLDTD command allows you to specify a public http/https URL to the public XML DTD file.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up5911">Upgrading from 5.91beta1 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <kbd><a href="dns.html#DNSTIMEOUT">DNSTIMEOUT</a></kbd> command is
  now off by default. On platforms where it's available, you have to specify
  it explicitly if you want it.
</ul>
  
<h2><a name="up5902">Upgrading from 5.90beta2 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="compout.html">computer-readable output style</a> now forces
  English language output. The idea is to have a consistent output style, and
  let the post-processor do any necessary localisation. But this may break some
  existing applications.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up532">Upgrading from 5.32 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The default output style is now XHTML, not HTML. Also the command-line
      argument &quot;<kbd>-a</kbd>&quot; selects XHTML, not HTML.
  <li>If you are using a style sheet for HTML output, it probably won't work
      well with XHTML output, because it <em>replaces</em> the default style
      sheet. So you will probably need to write a new one for XHTML.
  <li>The default for <kbd><a href="output.html#PNGIMAGES">PNGIMAGES</a></kbd>
      is now <kbd>ON</kbd>, so bar charts are made from png's not gif's by
      default. Some users may need to copy the png versions of the bar charts
      into their images directory.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up531">Upgrading from 5.31 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>More browsers are recognised, which will also reduce
      the Mozilla numbers.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up524">Upgrading from 5.24 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the Operating System Report, Macintosh is no longer split into PPC
      and 68k. (68k is now so rare that it's not worth it. Unfortunately,
      it's not possible to distinguish OS 9 from OS X, because the browsers
      don't all report it.)
  <li>The language files have changed, so don't try and use the old ones.
  <li>Some dead search engines have been removed from the default
      configuration file, and some new ones added.
  <li>Kilobytes, megabytes etc. are now listed to two not three decimal places
      by default; but you can configure the number of decimal places with the
      new <kbd><a href="output.html#RAWBYTES">BYTESDP</a></kbd> command.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up523">Upgrading from 5.23 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There will be small changes to the browser and operating system reports
      thanks to better parsing of recent Netscape and Mozilla browsers.
  <li>In version 5.23 and earlier, earlier <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> commands took
      precedence over later ones. This has been corrected in 5.24.
</ul>
      
<h2><a name="up521">Upgrading from 5.21 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>As a side-effect of the security fix in version 5.22, the
      <kbd>JAPANESE-JIS</kbd> character set no longer works from the form
      interface.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up51">Upgrading from 5.1 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The language files have all changed, so don't try and use the old ones.
  <li>The rules for generating &quot;organisations&quot; from numerical
      addresses have changed, which will change the Organisation Report.
  <li>Filenames given on the command line, as opposed to in configuration
      commands, are now relative to the current directory, not the analog
      directory. This will probably only affect Unix users.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up503">Upgrading from 5.03 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The code to generate the Browser Summary has been completely rewritten.
      Apart from now recognising Konqueror and Galeon, and distinguishing
      Mozilla and Netscape, this may result in other small changes to the
      reported numbers. Also, if you are using a configuration file from an
      earlier version, remove the line that reads
      <pre>BROWOUTPUTALIAS Mozilla Netscape</pre>
  <li>Similarly, the code to generate the Operating System Report has been
      slightly modified, in addition to recognising Windows XP.
  <li>Numerical addresses are now included in the Organisation Report, which
      will change that report.
  <li>Some <a href="errors.html#warns">warnings</a> have moved from category C
      to category F or to the new category G.
  <li><a href="args.html#SCC"><kbd>SEARCHCHARCONVERT</kbd></a> is now always
      turned off in multibyte character sets.
  <li>The <a href="othreps.html#CHART">default plotting method</a> for the pie
      charts will now take the <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> into account as well as the
      <kbd>SORTBY</kbd>.
  <li>The <a href="output.html#outstyle"><kbd>LATEX</kbd> output style</a> now
      produces LaTeX suitable for converting to PDF with the
      <kbd>pdflatex</kbd> command. If you want to use the ordinary
      <kbd>latex</kbd> command, specify <kbd>PDFLATEX OFF</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up502">Upgrading from 5.02 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The order of the lines in the report descriptions files has changed, so
      don't try to use the old versions.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up501">Upgrading from 5.01 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>LANGUAGE JAPANESE</kbd> now selects the JIS character set instead
      of EUC. (Four Japanese character sets can be chosen explicitly through
      the <kbd><a href="output.html#LANGUAGE">LANGUAGE</a></kbd> command.)
</ul>

<h2><a name="up50">Upgrading from 5.0 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The language files have all changed, so don't try and use the old ones.
  <li>Organisations in Belgium are now considered to be at depth 3, which will
      change the Organisation Report.
  <li>There are some new images in the <kbd>images/</kbd> directory, which you
      will have to copy into your <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up4911">Upgrading from 4.91beta1 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>LOCALCHARTDIR</kbd> and <kbd>DESCFILE</kbd> can no longer be
      specified from the form interface, for
      <a href="form.html#security">security reasons</a>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up4904">Upgrading from 4.90beta4 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Previously, when an <a href="include.html#outputexcludes">output
      <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> or <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd></a> command was in operation,
      the excluded items were still included in the &quot;not listed&quot;
      line at the bottom of the report. This is no longer the case.
      Also, percentages of the requests and bytes are now calculated
      <em>ignoring</em> the excluded items, which will make those numbers
      larger, make their wedges in the pie charts larger, and change what is
      included by <a href="othreps.html#FLOOR">floors</a> specified in terms of
      percentages.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up4903">Upgrading from 4.90beta3 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Operating System Report, Browser Report &amp; Browser Summary are now
    sorted by page requests instead of raw requests by default.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up4901">Upgrading from 4.90beta1 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There are some new files (with names beginning with <kbd>sq</kbd>) in
      the <kbd>images/</kbd> directory. These will need to be copied into your
      <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd>.
  <li><kbd>*.asp</kbd> is no longer included in the
      <a href="defns.html">default definition of &quot;pages&quot;</a> (which
      it was from 4.11 to 4.90beta1) because there are too many other equally
      well qualified candidates. But you can easily re-enable it in
      <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>.
  <li>The format of the &quot;busiest time&quot; and floor/sortby lines has
      changed in the <a href="compout.html">computer-readable output</a>.
  <li>The default <a href="dns.html#DNShours"><kbd>DNSGOODHOURS</kbd> and
      <kbd>DNSBADHOURS</kbd></a> have been increased. In particular, the
      default <kbd>DNSGOODHOURS</kbd> is now as near infinity as makes no
      difference!
</ul>

<h2><a name="up416">Upgrading from 4.16 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some languages have still not been translated for version 5 yet:
      see the list of available languages in the
      <cite><a href="whatsnew.html">What's new?</a></cite> section.
  <li>All files are now looked for in sensible directories, specified at
      compile time, if no other directory is specified. On platforms where
      these directories are not known at compile time, analog formerly looked
      in the current working directory, but now looks in (its guess at) the
      directory of the analog binary. However, filenames specified in command
      line arguments are within the current working directory since version
      5.2.
  <li>The cache file now includes data on the first-request time of each
      item. But if you read a cache file from an older version of analog, this
      data will not have been recorded, and so the last-request time will be
      used instead. Analog will warn you about this.
  <li>If you specify a <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd> command but no <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd>
      command, analog won't read the default (compile-time) logfile. This is
      much more intuitive behaviour, but some users may have been relying on
      the old behaviour. The actual rule is given in the documentation on
      <cite><a href="cache.html">Cache files</a></cite>.
  <li>Some browsers will be rediagnosed as robots in the Operating System
      Report. This will mainly reduce the &quot;OS unknown&quot; total, but
      may also reduce other categories.
  <li>US English now uses the 12-hour clock by default. If you
      want to continue to use the 24-hour clock, use the language file
      <kbd>us24.lng</kbd> instead. (Either use a
      <kbd><a href="output.html#LANGUAGE">LANGFILE</a></kbd> command, or
      rename <kbd>us24.lng</kbd> to <kbd>us.lng</kbd>). Conversely, you can
      get British English with the 12-hour clock by using <kbd>uk12.lng</kbd>.
  <li>Because of the twelve new reports, if you use a
      <kbd><a href="output.html#REPORTORDER">REPORTORDER</a></kbd> command,
      you should include the corresponding new
      <a href="output.html#replist">letters</a>: <kbd>1Q76wLlMRjyY</kbd>.
  <li><a href="compout.html">Computer readable output</a> now has an extra
      line reporting the busiest time period for the time reports.
  <li>The <a href="logfile.html#datecodes">date codes</a> in the
      <kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> and <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> commands now always
      produce dates in English.
  <li>The <kbd>REFLINKINCLUDE</kbd> command now only controls links in the
      Referrer Report. Use <kbd>REDIRREFLINKINCLUDE</kbd> and
      <kbd>FAILREFLINKINCLUDE</kbd> for the Redirected and Failed Referrer
      Reports.
  <li>When doing a negative <a href="othreps.html#FLOOR">floor</a>, items are
      no longer included if they have 0 of the criterion in question, even if
      there aren't enough items otherwise. For example <kbd>FLOOR -25p</kbd>
      will list fewer than 25 items if there aren't 25 items with requests for
      pages, even if there are other items with 0 requests for pages.
  <li>When a logfile line contains bytes but no filename, analog previously
      ignored the bytes. It now counts them for other items on the line, but
      doesn't put them in the File Size Report or General Summary (to avoid
      double-counting).
  <li>There are no longer any HTML language files containing HTML entities. So,
      for example, the HTML output will always contain a literal &eacute;
      instead of the code &amp;eacute;. This <em>should</em> make no
      difference to the reader, but please do tell me about any problems.
  <li>The source files have moved to the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory. And there
      are new source files in subdirectories of the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory.
      Also the  header files have different variables in them. This means that
      automatic build scripts will have to be rewritten.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up413">Upgrading from 4.13 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Regular expressions in an <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> or <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd>
      command must now occur on a line on their own, not within a
      comma-separated list.
  <li>The search terms reported in the Search Word and Search Query Reports
      are no longer converted to lower case if you are using a multibyte
      character set.
  <li>Unprintable characters in the output are now replaced by '?', except for
      multibyte character sets.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up411">Upgrading from 4.11 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>*INCLUDE ""</kbd> and <kbd>*EXCLUDE ""</kbd> (see
      <a href="include.html#incblank">documentation</a>) now apply to items
      which were present but corrupt. This may have the effect of including or
      excluding some new lines.
  <li>There has been a tiny change in <a href="compout.html">computer-readable
      output style</a>. Previously if a time was blank, it took up only one
      column. Now it takes up as many columns as if it had been present.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up41">Upgrading from 4.1 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="defns.html">default definition of &quot;pages&quot;</a> is
      now case insensitive: so it includes <kbd>*.HTM</kbd> and even
      <kbd>*.hTmL</kbd> etc. This will serve to increase the page count.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up404">Upgrading from 4.04 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is better parsing of extended format and WebSTAR format logs,
      which may cause differences in some cases.
  <li>All referrers now count as &quot;pages&quot; irrespective of
      any <kbd>PAGEINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>PAGEEXCLUDE</kbd> commands.
      Consequently, for example,
      &quot;<kbd>REFLINKINCLUDE&nbsp;pages</kbd>&quot; is now the
      same as &quot;<kbd>REFLINKINCLUDE&nbsp;*</kbd>&quot;. You can recreate
      the previous behaviour with
      &quot;<kbd>REFLINKINCLUDE&nbsp;*.html,*.htm,*/</kbd>&quot;.
  <li>The default <kbd>REPORTORDER</kbd> has changed.
  <li>New anchor names are used internally to the output page.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up403">Upgrading from 4.03 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There may be slight differences in the results in this version owing to
      stripping anchors off filenames.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up40">Upgrading from 4.0 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the default paths have changed in <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up390b1">Upgrading from 3.90beta1 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is now recommended that you don't run analog as a CGI program, or put
      it in the directory with your CGI programs, for
      <a href="form.html#notcgi">security reasons</a>.
  <li>Each browser in the Browser Summary is now sorted by major version
      number then minor version number. So <kbd>SUBBROW&nbsp;*/*</kbd> will now
      only show the major versions. To get all the minor versions, you need
      <kbd>SUBBROW&nbsp;*/*.*</kbd>
  <li><kbd>PAGEWIDTH</kbd> has been replaced by
      <kbd><a href="output.html#PAGEWIDTH">HTMLPAGEWIDTH</a></kbd> and
      <kbd><a href="output.html#PAGEWIDTH">ASCIIPAGEWIDTH</a></kbd>.
  <li><kbd>PRINTVARS</kbd> has been renamed
      <kbd><a href="syntax.html#settings">SETTINGS</a></kbd>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up332">Upgrading from 3.32 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The form interface has been completely rewritten, and old versions of
      <kbd>anlgform.html</kbd> will not work with this version.
  <li>The Browser Summary now diagnoses MSIE, Opera and WebTV browsers
      better. This will cause differences in output from previous versions.
  <li>With <kbd>RAWBYTES OFF</kbd>, bytes are now listed as, for example,
      47.68 Mbytes instead of 48,832 kbytes. This should be less confusing.
  <li>The <a href="dns.html">DNS file</a> has a new time encoding. It's only a
      few hours different, so I haven't made any special provision for it. The
      effect is that the <kbd><a href="dns.html">DNSGOODHOURS</a></kbd> and
      <kbd><a href="dns.html">DNSBADHOURS</a></kbd> may be a few hours out
      for existing entries (but not for new ones).
</ul>

<h2><a name="up33">Upgrading from 3.3 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is a new set of graphics in the <kbd>images</kbd> directory, which
      you will have to move to your web directory.
  <li>In the Mac version, if a configuration file is dragged onto the analog
      icon, it is used instead of, not as well as, the default configuration
      file.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up32">Upgrading from 3.2 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the <a href="compout.html">computer-readable output style</a>, the
      line <kbd>L7</kbd>, the time the last seven days begins after, has been
      replaced by <kbd>E7</kbd>, the time the last seven days ends. This is
      for consistency with the other output styles.
  <li>Also in the computer-readable output, there is a new line reporting the
      floor and the <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> for the report. In 3.11 and earlier,
      this didn't exist, and in 3.2 it only reported the floor, not the
      <kbd>SORTBY</kbd>.
  <li><kbd>%R</kbd> (Mac-style filename) has been abolished in the
      <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd>. Just use plain <kbd>%r</kbd> instead.
  <li>It is no longer allowed to set the <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> to be the
      same as a previous cache file.
  <li>The definition of the common log format and related formats changed
      between 3.11 &amp; 3.2, and again between 3.2 &amp; 3.3. This could
      cause differences in output, but they are likely to be only very minor.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up311">Upgrading from 3.11 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lines without a particular item now work properly with
      <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands. For example, if
      you do an <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> to look at only certain lines, then lines
      without that type of item at all will not now be included, whereas
      previously they would have been. This can make the results lower than in
      these earlier versions.
  <li>I have reluctantly removed support for NetPresenz logs. This hasn't
      worked for some time, and I have already been advising NetPresenz users
      not to use newer versions of analog because they could get wrong
      results. Unfortunately, fixing it would require a complete rewrite of
      the entire parsing code, which isn't going to happen any time soon. So
      my advice remains the same: continue to use version 2.11 or (even
      better) pre-process your logfiles into a form which analog can handle
      safely.
  <li>The English domains file has changed name from <kbd>domains.tab</kbd>
      to <kbd>ukdom.tab</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up30winform">Upgrading from 3.0, Win32 form interface</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If using the form interface on Windows, it is now necessary to put the
analog executable at <kbd>\analog\analog.exe</kbd> instead of
<kbd>\Program&nbsp;Files\analog\analog.exe</kbd>
</ul>

<h2><a name="up290b1">Upgrading from 2.90beta1</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT</kbd> has been replaced by
      <kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT-NA</kbd> and <kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT-INT</kbd>;
      and similarly for <kbd>LOGFORMAT NETPRESENZ</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="up211">Upgrading from 2.11 and earlier</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible that there may be small discrepancies between the results
      from previous versions and the results from this version because the
      parsing code has changed, but any such differences should be minor.
      However...
  <li>If you used to use <kbd>REFEXCLUDE</kbd> or <kbd>BROWEXCLUDE</kbd>, you
      most likely now want
      <kbd><a href="include.html#outputexcludes">REFREPEXCLUDE</a></kbd> or
      <kbd><a href="include.html#outputexcludes">BROWREPEXCLUDE</a></kbd>
      instead, or you will exclude lots of lines that were previously included.
  <li>It is possible that this version may not automatically parse a logfile
      that previous versions could parse, because it checks more carefully
      that the logfile is in the format claimed. If so, you will have to use a
      <kbd><a href="logfmt.html">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> command.
  <li>Approximate host counting has been abolished, unless there's a
      significant demand for it.
  <li>Count of number of new hosts in last seven days abolished. It was too
      confusing because it depended on which old logfiles you analysed.
  <li>The Error Report has been abolished (together with the configuration
      commands <kbd>ERROR</kbd>, <kbd>ERRLOG</kbd> and <kbd>ERRMINOCCS</kbd>).
      See the <cite><a href="whatsnew.html">What's new?</a></cite> page.
  <li>The <kbd>BROWLOG</kbd> and <kbd>REFLOG</kbd> commands have also been
      abolished: just use <kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFILE</a></kbd>
      instead.
  <li>The <kbd>HASHSIZE</kbd> commands have been abolished: analog now chooses
      the size of the hash tables itself.
  <li>The <kbd>MINREQS</kbd> and similar options have been replaced by the
      <kbd><a href="othreps.html#FLOOR">FLOOR</a></kbd> commands.
  <li>Only one <kbd>*</kbd> is now allowed on the left-hand side of aliases,
      to avoid ambiguities.
  <li>Automatic detection of log type is now on a per-file rather than a
      per-line basis.
  <li><kbd>ISPAGE</kbd> is now called
      <kbd><a href="include.html#PAGEINCLUDE">PAGEINCLUDE</a></kbd>.
  <li><kbd>WITHARGS</kbd> and <kbd>REFWITHARGS</kbd> are now called
      <kbd><a href="args.html#ARGSINCLUDE">ARGSINCLUDE</a></kbd> and
      <kbd><a href="args.html#ARGSINCLUDE">REFARGSINCLUDE</a></kbd>.
  <li><kbd>MONTHLYBACK</kbd> is now called <kbd>MONTHBACK</kbd>.
  <li><kbd>FULLHOSTS</kbd> is now just called <kbd>HOST</kbd>.
  <li>The old <kbd>LOGOURL</kbd> command is now called <kbd>LOGO</kbd>.
      <kbd>LOGOURL</kbd> now has a new function, namely where to link the logo
      to.
  <li>The <kbd>UNIT</kbd> commands have been abolished. They weren't very
      useful, and they didn't make much sense with the different ways of
      displaying the time report bar charts. The unit is now always chosen
      automatically.
  <li><kbd>DIRLEVEL</kbd> has been abolished, because the
      <kbd><a href="hierreps.html">SUBDIR</a></kbd> command is more general.
      Use <kbd>SUBDIR */*</kbd> or whatever instead.
  <li>Comments aren't allowed in the <a href="domfile.html">domains file</a>.
      I don't think this should cause a problem.
  <li><kbd>GRAPHICAL</kbd> is abolished. Instead, use lower case letters with
      the <kbd>GRAPH</kbd> commands.
  <li><kbd>NUMLOOKUP</kbd> has been replaced by
      <kbd><a href="dns.html">DNS</a></kbd>, and <kbd>DNSFRESHHOURS</kbd>
      by the commands <kbd><a href="dns.html">DNSGOODHOURS and
      DNSBADHOURS</a></kbd>.
  <li>DNS cache files from previous versions are not compatible with this
      version.
  <li>You can't use <kbd>PAGES</kbd> in the columns or <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> or
      <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> for the Request Report. Use <kbd>REQINCLUDE pages</kbd>
      instead.
  <li><kbd>-</kbd> as a synonym for <kbd>none</kbd> has been abolished in some
      places, e.g., <kbd>HOSTURL</kbd>.
  <li>The following command line arguments have been abolished from earlier
      versions, many of the letters getting new meanings: <kbd>7</kbd>,
      <kbd>l</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>,
      <kbd>v</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>. (<kbd>-v</kbd> has moved to
      <kbd>-settings</kbd>.) Others have been changed since version 1.2 as
      well.

  <li>The syntax of the <kbd>*FLOOR</kbd> commands has changed.

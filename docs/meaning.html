What the results mean</h1>
<hr size=2 noshade>

This section of the Readme is about understanding the results analog
produces. It's divided into three subsections.

<ul>
  <li><cite><a href="webworks.html">How the web works</a></cite>. This section
      discusses what happens when somebody connects to your web site, and what
      you can and can't find out about them. If you think that you can get
      statistics on how many people have visited your web site (or want to
      know why you can't), then this section is for you.
  <li><cite><a href="reports.html">Analog's reports</a></cite>. This section
      gives a summary of analog's reports, what they contain, and which
      commands influence each one.
  <li><cite><a href="defns.html">Analog's definitions</a></cite>. This section
      gives precise details on all of analog's terminology, exactly what is
      counted in each report, and so on.
</ul>

<hr size=2 noshade>

Analog is a program which analyses logfiles from WWW servers. It works on
almost any operating system. It is designed to be fast and to produce
accurate and attractive statistics: and combined with
<a href="http://www.reportmagic.org/">Report Magic</a>, you
can generate
<a HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sret1/stats/reportmagic/">even
prettier reports</a>. It's free software.

<p>
Although analog is free software, its distribution and modification are
covered by the terms of the <a href="Licence.txt">GNU General Public
License</a>. You are not required to accept this licence, but nothing else
gives you permission to modify or distribute the program. Analog comes with
<em>no warranty</em>.

<p>
Although analog is free, if you like it, please consider
<a href="https://www.c-amie.co.uk/software/analog/">making a donation</a> towards its
development. Thank you.

The files in this directory are from version 3.4 of Philip Hazel's PCRE
library, but have been heavily modified by Stephen Turner for use in analog.
In particular:
  * All filenames now begin with "pcre";
  * Only functions I use in analog have been retained;
  * All debugging code has been removed;
  * Most source comments have been removed.
Therefore these routines are NOT SUITABLE for use in your own program.
Get the latest version of PCRE from http://www.pcre.org/ instead.

Many thanks to Philip Hazel for his excellent routines and generous licence.

The files in this directory are from version 1.8.1 of Thomas Boutell's gd
library, but have been heavily modified by Stephen Turner for use in analog.
In particular:
  * Only functions I use in analog have been retained;
  * Most source comments have been removed.
Therefore these routines are NOT SUITABLE for use in your own program.
Get the latest version of libgd from http://www.boutell.com/gd/ instead.

Many thanks to Thomas Boutell for his excellent routines and generous licence.

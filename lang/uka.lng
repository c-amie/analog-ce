## Language file for analog 6.0. May not work with any other version.
##
## This is a language file for analog. Lines beginning with ## are comments.
## Each language should have one language file in its own character set,
## and can have an additional one for ASCII (7 bit) output.
## 
## If your language doesn't seem to fit into this pattern, explain the problem
## to me, and I can adjust the source code if necessary.

## The character set of this language file. Prefix with a * to indicate a

## The non-time reports. In each case, we have the name of the report,
## followed by the type of item in the report, once in the singular and once
## in the plural. These are used in phrases like "listing ??? with at
## least 200 requests". (The words higher up are used for column headings and
## for the "not listed" lines at the bottom of the reports.)
## Finally we have the gender of this type of object, which can be m, f or n.
##
## So for example, in German a directory is Verzeichnis (neuter gender), which
## was given above. But "listing the top directory" is "Ausgabe des ersten
## Verzeichnisses" and "listing the top two directories" is "Ausgabe der
## ersten zwei Verzeichnisse". So here, we would have for the directory report:
##
## Verzeichnis-Bericht
## Verzeichnisses
## Verzeichnisse
## n
##
## I hope that makes sense!

## Column headings for requests, pages, bytes and number (ie position in list)
## and percentages and last-7-day versions of these.
## Should be as short as possible -- abbreviate if necessary.
## (The ?bytes represents kbytes, Mbytes etc.)

## Now we need to know how to say "listing the top <whatever>", "listing
## the top <n> <whatevers>", and "listing <whatevers>". The %s and %d
## will be replaced by the appropriate things. There may be three of each of
## these statements, for the genders m, f and n. Any genders that aren't used,
## you can just put a * there instead. So, for example, French starts
## Affichage du premier %s
## Affichage de la premi&egrave;re %s
## *
## with entries for m & f, but not n
*
*
Listing the top %s
*
*
Listing the top %d %s

## The separators to use between thousands, and as a decimal point. For
## example, English generally uses "3,000.25" so has , and . here. French uses
## "3 000,25", so has space and , instead.
,
.
## There's a colon here, because the French like to put a space before a colon,
## so they have space-colon instead here.

## am and pm in the sense of morning and afternoon.

## Some date formats. E.g. for 9am on 1st January 1997 use
## %d for date          " 1"
## %D for 0-padded date "01"
## %e or %E for date at end of time interval (where this makes sense)
## %m for month         "Jan"
## %l for month at end of time interval
## %q for quarter of the year    "1"
## %y for short year    "97"
## %Y for long year     "1997"
## %z or %Z for year at end of time interval
## %X for ISO 8601 extended date format (yyyy-mm-dd) "1997-01-01"
## %h for hour in 24-hour clock " 9"
## %H for 0-padded hour         "09"
## %j for hour in 12-hour clock " 9"
## %i, %I or %k for hour at end of time interval
## %n for minute        "00"
## %o for minute at end of time interval
## %a for am or pm      "am"
## %b for am or pm at end of time interval
## %w for weekday       "Wed"
## %x for a dash in a range e.g. in 14:00-14:15. This is necessary because in
##    proper typesetting, this should be an en-dash not a regular dash.
##
## So for a date, English might have %d/%m/%y for 1/Jan/97, whereas German
## would have %d.%m %y for 1.Jan 97). Note: the month number is not available
## because it can produce ambiguous dates.
##
## The different date formats are as follows
## "refer to the 7 days to [date]"
%D-%m-%Y %H:%n
## "Program started at" and "Analysed requests from"
%w-%D-%m-%Y %H:%n

## The date (d) column in non-time reports
%d/%m/%y
## The date & time (D) column in non-time reports
%d/%m/%y %H:%n

%d/%m/%y at %H:%n
